questions:
  - q: What's an API check run?
    a: API checks are monitors that do POST, GET, and other typical HTTP requests. You have full control
      over the payload, headers, etc. You can also create assertions to check if the response from your API is valid and performant.
      For billing, we count any HTTP request as a check run. API check runs have a timeout threshold of 30 seconds.
  - q: What is a browser check run?
    a: Browser checks are monitors based on Node.js scripts using frameworks like Mocha, Puppeteer,
      and Playwright. Each browser check uses an actual Chrome browser to execute clicks, fill out forms and validate if
      these interactions have the correct results. This is also commonly called “synthetic monitoring”. For billing we count
      every executed script as a check run. Browser check runs have a timeout threshold of 60 seconds.
  - q: How does the hobby plan work?
    a: By signing up for the hobby plan, you get access to almost all of Checkly's features. You do not need a credit card
      to get started. You can execute up to 50,000 API and 5,000 browser check runs.
  - q: What does fair use mean?
    a: Fair use limits are soft boundaries that apply to certain features. The limits are set in a way that most customers
      should not encounter any limitations. On a Team plan, you can invite up to 99 users, have
      25 public dashboards, and 200 SMS alerts per month. If you exceed the thresholds, we will reach out and discuss options with you.
  - q: Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?
    a: "For the **Hobby plan** upgrades and downgrades don't apply.<br><br>
      **Downgrade Team plan**: You can reduce the number of prepaid checks from account settings. The changes will apply after
      your current subscription cycle automatically."
  - q: Can I change plans?
    a: When you are on a Hobby plan or Team plan, you can switch to all plans anytime, and the changes will apply
      immediately.
  - q: How do you bill?
    a: Prepaid plans, like the Team plan, are paid upfront at the beginning of the subscription cycle. Overages will be added to the invoice
      of the next subscription cycle.
  - q: What payment types do you accept?
    a: We accept Visa, Mastercard, and American Express credit card payments. Stripe handles all payments. For custom plans, we also accept invoice payments.
  - q: Do you support early startups or nonprofits?
    a: Yes! We do support early-stage startups that are younger than two years by providing a 30% discount on all plans.
      Nonprofits qualify for a 50% discount. [Apply here](https://forms.gle/V5fMnaD1ABCfPNfdA)
