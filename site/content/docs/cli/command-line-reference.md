## `npx checkly test`

Executes all the checks in the scope of your project on the Checkly cloud infrastructure. You can specify files to run by
appending a pattern, e.g. `npx checkly test home.spec.js api`.

Dry run all checks in your repo:

```bash
npx checkly test
```

Dry run checks that have `product` and `api` in the file name

```bash
npx checkly test product api
```

Record a test session in Checkly with git branch info, full logging, videos and traces.

```bash
npx checkly test --record
```

Dry run all checks against a specific location:

```bash
npx checkly test --location eu-west-1
```

Dry run checks while passing a specific URL and a password. These variables are available on `process.env`

```bash
npx checkly test --env "ENVIRONMENT_URL=https://preview.acme.com" --env PASSWORD=doremiabc123
```

This is very powerful when combined with passing environment variables using one of the flags `--env` or `--env-file` as you can target staging, test and preview environment with specific URLs, credentials and other common variables that differ
between environments.

- `--config` or `-c`: You can specify a particular configuration file, e.g. `--config="./checkly.staging.config.ts"`
- `--env <key=value>` or `-e`: Pass environment variables to the check execution runtime. Passed variables overwrite any existing variables stored in your Checkly account.
- `--env-file`: You can read variables from a `.env` file by passing the file path e.g. `--env-file="./.env"`
- `--grep <pattern>` or `-g`: Only run checks where the check name matches a regular expression.
- `--list`: Just list the checks in your project, but don't run them.
- `--location <location>` or `-l`: Run checks against a specified location, e.g. `eu-west-1`. Defaults to `us-east-1`.
- `--private-location <private location ID>`: Run checks against the specified private location.
- `--record:` Record tests results in Checkly as a test session.
- `--reporter` or `-r`: A list of custom reporters for the test output. Options are: list|dot|ci|github.
- `--tags` or `-t`: Filter the checks using a comma separated list of tags. Checks will only be run if
  they contain all the specified tags. Multiple `--tags` flags can be passed, in which case checks will be run if they
  match any of the `--tags` filters, i.e. `--tags production,webapp --tags staging,backend` will run checks with tags
  (production AND webapp) OR (staging AND backend).
- `--timeout`: A fallback timeout (in seconds) to wait for checks to complete.
- `--verbose` or `-v`: Always show the full logs of the checks.


## `npx checkly deploy`

Deploys all your checks and associated resources like alert channels to your Checkly account.

Preview the differences between your actual configuration and your account

```bash
npx checkly deploy --preview
```

Deploy all resources to your Checkly account

```bash
npx checkly deploy
```

- `--config` or `-c`: You can specify a particular configuration file, e.g. `--config="./checkly.staging.config.ts"`
- `--force` or `-f`: Skips the confirmation dialog when deploying. Handy in CI environments.
- `--preview` or `-p`: Preview the differences between your actual configuration and your account.
- `--output` or `-o`: Show applied differences after deploying.
- `--no-schedule-on-deploy`: Do not run checks when deploying.

When you deploy a project, you can attach Git specific information so changes to any resources are displayed in the
Checkly web UI wit the correct commit, owner etc.

{{< markdownpartial "/_shared/cli-env-vars.md" >}}

Some of the above variables will be detected automatically detected from your local or CI environment on a best effort basis.

## `npx checkly destroy`

Destroy all project's resources (checks, groups, alert channels, etc.) from your Checkly account.

- `--config` or `-c`: You can specify a particular configuration file, e.g. `--config="./checkly.staging.config.ts"`
- `--force` or `-f`: Skips the confirmation dialog when deploying. Handy in CI environments.

## `npx checkly trigger`

The `trigger` command is similar to the `test` command, but "triggers" checks already in your Checkly account. This works
regardless of whether you created these checks via a `Project` with CLI constructs, via the UI or using Terraform.

Because `trigger` does not rely on any `Project` or as-code representation of your checks, the invocation is slightly
different, as there are no files to reference for instance.

```bash
npx checkly trigger
```

Trigger checks tagged with "production" and "api" and pass in an `ENVIRONMENT_URL`.

```bash
npx checkly trigger --tags=production,api -e ENVIRONMENT_URL=https://staging.acme.com
```

Trigger all checks to run in location `eu-west-1` and record a test session named "Adhoc test run".

```bash
npx checkly trigger --record --test-session-name="Adhoc test run" --location=eu-west-1
```

- `--config` or `-c`: You can specify a particular configuration file, e.g. `--config="./checkly.staging.config.ts"`
- `--env <key=value>` or `-e`: Pass environment variables to the check execution runtime. Passed variables overwrite any existing variables stored in your Checkly account.
- `--env-file`: You can read variables from a `.env` file by passing the file path e.g. `--env-file="./.env"`
- `--location <location>` or `-l`: Run checks against a specified location, e.g. `eu-west-1`. Defaults to `us-east-1`.
- `--private-location <private location ID>`: Run checks against the specified private location.
- `--record:` Record tests results in Checkly as a test session.
- `--reporter` or `-r`: A list of custom reporters for the test output. Options are: list|dot|ci|github.
- `--tags` or `-t`: Filter the checks to be triggered using a comma separated list of tags. Checks will only be run if
they contain all the specified tags. Multiple `--tags` flags can be passed, in which case checks will be run if they
match any of the `--tag`s filters, i.e. `--tags production,webapp --tags staging,backend` will run checks with tags
(production AND webapp) OR (staging AND backend).
- `--test-session-name` A name to use when storing results in Checkly with `--record`.
- `--timeout`: A fallback timeout (in seconds) to wait for checks to complete. Default 240.
- `--verbose` or `-v`: Always show the full logs of the checks.

## `npx checkly login`

Sign up for a new Checkly account or log in to your existing Checkly account.

## `npx checkly logout`

Logs you out of your Checkly account.

## `npx checkly whoami`

Prints the account and user you are currently logged in with.

## `npx checkly switch`

Switch which account you are logged into based on the accounts you can access with your credentials.

## `npx checkly runtimes`

List all available runtimes and their dependencies.

## `npx checkly env`

Manage the global environment variables of a Checkly account. You can list, add, remove, update and export environment variables.

### `npx checkly env pull`

Export global environment variables from your Checkly account to a local `.env` file or a different file of your choice.

```bash
checkly env pull [FILENAME] [-f]
```

- `FILENAME`: You can specify a particular environment variable file, e.g. `.env.local`
- `--force` or `-f`: Skips the confirmation dialog when pulling environment variables to existing env file.

```bash
npx checkly env pull -f
```
Pull all environment variables to the `.env` file and overwrite it if it already exists.

### `npx checkly env ls`

List global environment variables. This command does not list environment variables on group or check level.

```bash
checkly env ls
```

### `npx checkly env add`

Add a global environment variable.

```bash
checkly env add [KEY] [VALUE] [-l]

```bash
checkly env update [KEY] [VALUE] [-l]
