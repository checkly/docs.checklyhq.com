## `Project`

A `Project` defines core settings and defaults for the CLI and other constructs like Checks. In many cases, you can just
use set defaults for your Checks in the `checks` property and override them occasionally at the Check or CheckGroup level.

```ts {title="checkly.config.ts"}
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'
import { Frequency } from 'checkly/constructs'

export default defineConfig({
  projectName: 'Website Monitoring',
  logicalId: 'website-monitoring-1',
  repoUrl: 'https://github.com/acme/website',
  checks: {
    activated: true,
    muted: false,
    runtimeId: '2025.04',
    frequency: Frequency.EVERY_5M,
    locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
    tags: ['website', 'api'],
    checkMatch: '**/__checks__/*.check.ts',
    ignoreDirectoriesMatch: [],
    playwrightConfig: {},
    browserChecks: {
      frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,
      testMatch: '**/__checks__/*.spec.ts',
    },
  },
  cli: {
    runLocation: 'eu-west-1',
    privateRunLocation: 'private-dc1',
    retries: 0,
  },
})
```

- `projectName`: A friendly name for your Project.
- `logicalId`: A unique identifier for this Project. Like all logical ID's, this should be stable.
- `repoUrl`: An optional URL to a Git repository.

- `checks`: Top-level defaults for all Checks in this Project. If not overridden at the Check or CheckGroup level, these
settings apply to your Checks. Takes all [Check properties](#check).
  - `checkMatch`: A glob pattern where the CLI should look for files containing Check constructs. For more info check [the
    dedicated docs on checkMatch and testMatch](/docs/cli/using-check-test-match/)
  - `ignoreDirectoriesMatch`: An array of glob patterns which directories should be ignored by the `checkMatch` property.
  - `playwrightConfig`: [Subset of Playwright configuration options](/docs/browser-checks/playwright-test/#global-configuration)
  - `browserChecks`: Top-level defaults specifically for Browser Checks generated by a glob match pattern. All [Check properties](#check)
  are valid here.
    - `testMatch`: Glob pattern where the CLI looks for Playwright test files, i.e. all `.spec.ts` files. For more info check [the
dedicated docs on checkMatch and testMatch](/docs/cli/using-check-test-match/)

- `cli`: Defaults for CLI commands.
  - `runLocation`: The default run location when running `npx checkly test` and `npx checkly trigger`.
  - `privateRunLocation`: The default private run location when running `npx checkly test` and `npx checkly trigger`.
  - `retries`: The number of times to retry a failing check run when running `npx checkly test` and `npx checkly trigger`. 0 by default and maximum 3.

## Shared configuration for your checks and monitors

Checks and monitors share a common set of properties for configuration:

| Property                | Description                                                                                                                         | Supported In                              |

> Note that most properties have sane default values and do not need to be specified.

## Synthetic Checks
Checkly synthetic checks are automated end to end tests that simulate user interactions or API requests to monitor the performance and availability of web applications and services.

## `ApiCheck`

API Checks are a good fit for monitoring typical HTTP based endpoints like REST APIs and GraphQL APIs, but can also be
used for form encoded payloads. The example below shows the following:

- It defines the basic Check properties like `name`, `activated` etc.
- It defines the HTTP method `POST`, `url` and the `body`
- It sets an extra header in the `headers` array.
- It sets an extra parameter in the `queryParameters` array, although you could add that to the URL directly too.
- It defines an array of assertions using the `AssertionBuilder` to assert that:
  - the HTTP response status is `200`
  - the JSON response body has a property called `name` by using the [JSON path](https://jsonpath.com/) expression `$.name`
  - the `strict-transport-security` response header's `max-age` property has a value greater than 100000.
- It runs a **setup script** and **teardown script**, which are just TypeScript files referenced from the same directory.


The file hierarchy looks as follows:

```
├── __checks__
│   ├── hello-api.check.ts
│   ├── setup.ts
│   ├── teardown.ts
```

```ts {title="hello-api.check.ts"}
import { ApiCheck, AssertionBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'
import * as path from 'path'

new ApiCheck('hello-api-1', {
  name: 'Hello API',
  activated: true,
  setupScript: {
      entrypoint: path.join(__dirname, 'setup.ts')
  },
  tearDownScript: {
    entrypoint: path.join(__dirname, 'teardown.ts')
  },
  maxResponseTime: 10000,
  degradedResponseTime: 5000,
  request: {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'https://httpbin.org/post',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'checkly'
    }),
    skipSSL: false,
    followRedirects: true,
    headers: [
      {
        key: 'X-My-Header',
        value: 'My custom header value'
      }
    ],
    queryParameters: [
      {
        key: 'myParam',
        value: 'true'
      }
    ],
    assertions: [
        AssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200),
        AssertionBuilder.jsonBody('$.name').notEmpty(),
        AssertionBuilder.headers('strict-transport-security', 'max-age=(\\d+)').greaterThan(10000),
    ]
  }
})
```

- `setupScript`: An object with either an `entrypoint` property that points to a `.js|ts` file, or a `content` property with
raw JavaScript / TypeScript as a string. This runs before the API check is executed. Check [our docs on how to use setup and teardown scripts](/docs/api-checks/setup-teardown-scripts/).
- `tearDownScript`: An object with either an `entrypoint` property that points to a `.js|ts` file, or a `content` property with
  raw JavaScript / TypeScript as a string. This runs after the API check is executed. Check [our docs on how to use setup and teardown scripts](/docs/api-checks/setup-teardown-scripts/).
- `maxResponseTime`: The response time in milliseconds where a check should be considered failing.
- `degradedResponseTime`: The response time in milliseconds where a check should be considered degraded.
- `shouldFail`: Choose whether a failure should count as a pass. All requests with status code 400 or higher are reported as passed if set to `true`. The default behaviour if this setting is not defined is `false`.
- `request`: An object of the `Request` type. See the [`Request` reference](#request).

### `Request`

The `request` object is a mandatory part of an API check.

- `url`: A string for the target URL.
- `method`: The HTTP method as a string, i.e. `GET | POST | PUT | PATCH | HEAD | DELETE | OPTIONS`
- `body`: A string for HTTP request body.
- `bodyType`: A string indicating the type of body. Options are `JSON | FORM | RAW | GRAPHQL | NONE`. This property is mostly
for rendering the body type in the web UI and not needed in most cases using the CLI.
- `headers`: An array of `{ key: 'X-My-Header', value: 123 }` objects to define HTTP headers.
- `queryParameters`: An array of `{ key: 'my-param', value: 123 }` objects to define query parameters.
- `followRedirects`: A boolean indicating automatic following of any `30x` redirects.
- `skipSSL`: A boolean indicating whether invalid or self-signed SSL certificates should be validated.
- `basicAuth`: An object of the shape `{ username: 'admin', password: 'admin' }` to set basic auth credentials.
- `assertions`: An array of assertions to validate status codes, response bodies and much more.
See the [`AssertionBuilder` reference](#assertionbuilder).

### `AssertionBuilder`

To define `assertions` for the `request` of an `ApiCheck` you should use the `AssertionBuilder`. The `AssertionBuilder` provides a fluent
API for the otherwise slightly cryptic JSON object that the CLI passes to the Checkly API. Here are some examples:

- Asserting an HTTP status code.

```ts
AssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200)
// renders to a JSON string
"{ source: 'STATUS_CODE', regex: '', property: '', comparison: 'EQUALS', target: '200' }"
```

- Asserting a part of a JSON response body using a JSON path expression. [Learn more about using JSON path](/docs/api-checks/assertions/#json-responses-with-json-path).

```ts
AssertionBuilder.jsonBody('$.data').greaterThan(2000),
// renders to a JSON string
"{ source: 'JSON_BODY', regex: '', property: '$.data', comparison: 'GREATER_THAN', target: '2000' }"
```

- Asserting the value of a part of an HTTP response header. Note that you can pass in a regex as the second argument.

```ts
AssertionBuilder.headers('strict-transport-security', 'max-age=(\\d+)').greaterThan(10000),
// renders to a JSON string
"{ source: 'HEADERS', regex: 'max-age=(\d+)', property: 'strict-transport-security', comparison: 'GREATER_THAN', target: '100000' }"
```

The `AssertionBuilder` defines the following sources as an entry to building an assertion.

- `statusCode()`: Assert the HTTP status code for the HTTP request, e.g. `200` or `404`.
- `jsonBody(property?)`: Assert the JSON response body. Accepts a [JSON path expression](/docs/api-checks/assertions/#json-responses-with-json-path) as the `property` argument.
- `textBody()`: Assert the body as raw text.
- `headers(propery?, regex?)`: Assert a set of response headers, takes the header name as the `property` argument and a `regex` to tease out a string from the header value.
- `responseTime()`: Assert the total response time of the HTTP request.

Read more about assertions in [our docs on API check assertions](/docs/api-checks/assertions/).

## `BrowserCheck`

Browser Checks are based on [`@playwright/test`](https://playwright.dev/). You can just write `.spec.js|ts` files with test cases
and the Checkly CLI will pick them up and apply some default settings like a name, run locations and run frequency to turn
them into synthetic monitoring Checks.

However, you can override these global settings and configure individual Browser Checks just like all other built-in Check
types. The most important thing is to set the `code.entrypoint` property and point it to your Playwright `.spec.js|ts` file.
This property supports relative and absolute paths.

```ts {title="browser.check.ts"}
import { BrowserCheck, Frequency } from 'checkly/constructs'
import * as path from 'path'

new BrowserCheck('browser-check-1', {
  name: 'Browser check #1',
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  code: {
    entrypoint: path.join(__dirname, 'home.spec.js')
  }
})
```

- `code`: an object with either an `entrypoint` property that points to `.spec.js|ts` file, or a `content` property with
raw JavaScript / TypeScript as a string.

## `MultiStepCheck`

Similar to Browser checks, Multistep checks uses [`@playwright/test`](https://playwright.dev/) to define the script which the check runs, but Multistep checks always need to be defined in a construct before assigning a `spec.js|ts` file.

> Multistep checks are only supported on runtime 2023.09 or later. See [Runtimes](/docs/runtimes/) for more details.

```ts {title="multistep.check.ts"}
import { MultiStepCheck, Frequency } from 'checkly/constructs'
import * as path from 'path'

new MultiStepCheck('multistep-check-1', {
  name: 'Multistep Check #1',
  runtimeId: '2025.04',
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  code: {
    entrypoint: path.join(__dirname, 'home.spec.ts')
  },
})
```

- `code`: an object with either an `entrypoint` property that points to `.spec.js|ts` file, or a `content` property with
raw JavaScript / TypeScript as a string.

## Uptime Monitors

Use Uptime monitors to regularly check if a website, port, or service is available and responding as expected.

## `UrlMonitor`
Use URL monitors to track basic availability and HTTP status codes of your services. The example below:

- Defined basic monitor properties like `name`, `activated` etc.
- Sends a `GET` rquest to a target `url`.
- Includes an assertion that expects an HTTP 200 OK response.
- Sets thresholds for when the check should be marked as degraded or failing.

The file hierarchy looks as follows:

```
├── __checks__
│   ├── hello-url.check.ts
```

```ts {title="hello-url.check.ts"}
import { UrlMonitor, UrlAssertionBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'

new UrlMonitor('hello-url-1', {
  name: 'Hello URL',
  activated: true,
  maxResponseTime: 10000,
  degradedResponseTime: 5000,
  request: {
    url: 'https://httpbin.org/get',
    skipSSL: false,
    followRedirects: true,
    assertions: [
        UrlAssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200),
    ]
  }
})
```

### `Request`

The `request` object is a mandatory part of an URL monitor.

- `url`: The HTTP(S) URL to monitor.
- `followRedirects`: A boolean indicating automatic following of any `30x` redirects.
- `skipSSL`: A boolean indicating whether to skip validation of SSL certificates.
- `assertions`: You can define assertions via the `UrlAssertionBuilder`. For URL monitors, only status code assertions are supported. For example:

```ts
UrlAssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200)
// renders to a JSON string
"{ source: 'STATUS_CODE', regex: '', property: '', comparison: 'EQUALS', target: '200' }"
```

## `TcpMonitor`

> [!NOTE]
> Previously called TcpCheck, this construct is now available as TcpMonitor. Both names work the same, but we recommend using TcpMonitor going forward.

TCP monitors are ideal for monitoring services and protocols that use TCP, such as FTP, messaging protocols like MQTT and XMPP, among others. The example below shows the following:

- It defines the basic monitor properties like `name`, `activated` etc.
- It defines the `hostname`, `port`, and `data`
- It defines an array of assertions using the `TcpAssertionBuilder` to assert that:
  - the total response time is within the given limit
  - the response contains the provided value

The file hierarchy looks as follows:

```
├── __checks__
│   ├── hello-tcp.check.ts
```

```ts {title="hello-tcp.check.ts"}
import { TcpMonitor, TcpAssertionBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'

new TcpMonitor('hello-tcp-1', {
  name: 'Hello TCP',
  activated: true,
  maxResponseTime: 5000,
  degradedResponseTime: 4000,
  request: {
    hostname: 'tcpbin.com',
    port: 4242,
    data: 'ping\n',
    ipFamily: 'IPv6',
    assertions: [
        TcpAssertionBuilder.responseTime().lessThan(1000),
        TcpAssertionBuilder.responseData().contains('ping')
    ]
  }
})
```

- `maxResponseTime`: The response time in milliseconds where a monitor should be considered failing.
- `degradedResponseTime`: The response time in milliseconds where a monitor should be considered degraded.
- `request`: An object of the `TcpRequest` type. See the [`TcpRequest` reference](#tcprequest).
- `shouldFail`: When set to `true`, the monitor is considered successful if the connection attempt fails. If not specified, the default value is `false`. 

> [!NOTE]
> Failing assertions will cause the monitor to fail, regardless of the `shouldFail` value

### `TcpRequest`

The `request` object is a mandatory part of an TCP monitor.

- `hostname`: The hostname the connection should be made to. Do not include a scheme or a port in the hostname.
- `port`: The port the connection should be made to.
- `ipFamily`: The IP family to use for the connection. Defaults to `IPv4`.
- `data`: The data to send to the target host. Only `string` values are supported.
- `assertions`: An array of assertions to validate response time and response data.
See the [`TcpAssertionBuilder` reference](#tcpassertionbuilder).

### `TcpAssertionBuilder`

To define `assertions` for the `request` of an `TcpMonitor` you should use the `TcpAssertionBuilder`. The `TcpAssertionBuilder`
has the following properties:

- `responseTime()`: Assert the total response time of the TCP request.
- `responseData()`: Assert the value in the response data.

 Here are some examples:

- Assert the total response time of the TCP request

```ts
TcpAssertionBuilder.responseTime().lessThan(1000),
// renders to a JSON string
"{ source: 'RESPONSE_TIME', regex: '', property: '', comparison: 'LESS_THAN', target: '1000' }"
```

- Asserting the value in the response.

```ts
TcpAssertionBuilder.responseData().contains('ping')
// renders to a JSON string
"{ source: 'RESPONSE_DATA', regex: '', property: '', comparison: 'CONTAINS', target: 'ping' }"
```

## `HeartbeatMonitor`

> [!NOTE]
> Previously called HeartbeatCheck, this construct is now available as HeartbeatMonitor. Both names work the same, but we recommend using HeartbeatMonitor going forward.

A heartbeat monitor is a passive monitor type that expects pings from an external source, such as a scheduled job on a server, at a defined interval. A ping is an HTTP request to a given endpoint URL.

You can obtain the ping URL from our [user interface](https://app.checklyhq.com/heartbeats) or the CLI output of [`checkly deploy`](/docs/cli/command-line-reference/#npx-checkly-deploy).

```ts {title="heartbeat.check.ts"}
import { HeartbeatMonitor } from 'checkly/constructs'

new HeartbeatMonitor('heartbeat-monitor-1', {
  name: 'Send weekly newsletter job',
  period: 7,
  periodUnit: 'days',
  grace: 2,
  graceUnit: 'hours',
})
```

- `period`: The expected period of time between each ping. Between 30 seconds and 365 days.

- `periodUnit`: The unit of time for the period, the available options are `'seconds' | 'minutes' | 'hours' | 'days'`.

- `grace`: The grace period to wait for before sending an alert. Between 0 seconds and 365 days.

- `graceUnit`: The unit of time for the grace period, the available options are `'seconds' | 'minutes' | 'hours' | 'days'`.

## `CheckGroupV2`

Use the CheckGroupV2 construct to organize your Checks into groups. This comes with the following benefits:

1. Your Checks are organized in a folder in the Checkly web UI.
2. You can trigger all Checks in a group from the web UI and via a command line trigger.
3. You can manage group-level configuration like the runtime, activated & muted-state, tags and alert channels that trickle down to all the Checks in the group.

> [!WARNING]
> If you add a check to a group with group-level alert settings ON, the check will only send alerts through the group’s alert channels. Make sure the group has at least one alert channel connected, otherwise you won’t receive any alerts for that check.

> Note: you will notice that managing shared configuration between Checks is very easy just using JS/TS. You might not need Check Groups for that purpose.

#### Adding Checks to a Check Group

You can add a Check to a group in two ways.

1. By passing the `CheckGroupV2` object for the `group` property of a Check.
2. For Browser Checks, we allow you to use the `testMatch` glob pattern to include any `.spec.js|ts` file, without having to
   create a `BrowserCheck` construct. This works the same ast the `testMatch` glob at the Project level.

```ts {title="group.check.ts"}
import { CheckGroupV2, ApiCheck, Frequency } from 'checkly/constructs'

const group = new CheckGroupV2('check-group-1', {
  name: 'Group',
  activated: true,
  muted: false,
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_15M,
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  tags: ['api-group'],
  concurrency: 10,
  browserChecks: {
    frequency: Frequency.EVERY_30M,
    testMatch: '*.spec.js'
  }
})

new ApiCheck('check-group-api-check-1', {
  name: 'API check #1',
  group,
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://mac-demo-repo.vercel.app/api/hello',
  }
})
```

- `name` (required): A friendly name for your Check Group.
- `activated`: Boolean that determines whether the Checks in the group are running or not. When set to true (default), all activated Checks within the group will run. When set to false, no Checks in the group will run, regardless of whether they are activated or not.
- `muted`: Boolean that controls alerting behavior for the group. When set to false (default), alerting follows the individual Check’s muted setting. When set to true, no alerts will be sent for any Checks in the group — even if the individual Checks are not muted.
- `concurrency`: A number indicating the amount of concurrent Checks to run when a group is triggered.
- `frequency`: How often to run the Checks within the group, i.e. `Frequency.EVERY_15M` for every fifteen minutes.
- `locations`: An array of one or more [public locations](/docs/monitoring/global-locations) where Checks in this group should run (e.g. `['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1']`). If this or `privateLocations` is set, it overrides the location settings of all Checks in the group.
- `privateLocations`: An array of one or more [private locations](/docs/private-locations) where Checks in this group should run (e.g. `['datacenter-east-1']`). If this or `locations` is set, it overrides the location settings of all Checks in the group.
- `alertChannels`: An array of [AlertChannel](#alertchannel) objects to be alerted on when checks in this group fail or recover.
- `tags`: An array of tags i.e. `['product', 'api']`. Group tags trickle down to tags on the individual Checks.
- `runtimeId`: The ID of which [runtime](/docs/runtimes/specs/) to use for the Checks in the group. Use this if the checks in this group require a different runtime than your account default.
- `environmentVariables`: An array of objects defining [environment variables in the group scope](/docs/groups/variables), i.e. `[{ key: 'DEBUG', value: 'true', secret: true | locked: true }]`.
- `localSetupScript`: Any JS/TS code as a string to run before each API Check in this group.
- `localTearDownScript`: Any JS/TS code as a string to run after each API Check in this group.
- `retryStrategy`: A [RetryStrategy](#retrystrategy) object configuring [retries](/docs/alerting-and-retries/) for failed Check runs. If set, all checks in the group use the group's retry strategy. If not set, individual Check settings are used.
- `apiCheckDefaults`: A set of [defaults for API Checks](/docs/groups/api-check-defaults/). This should not be needed. Just compose shared defaults using JS/TS.
- `browserChecks`: A set of defaults for Browser Checks. This should not be needed. Just compose shared defaults using JS/TS.
- `runParallel`: Controls how Checks in the group are executed across locations. When `true`, all Checks run in parallel across all configured locations. When `false`, they run in round-robin mode. If **not set**, each Check uses its own scheduling strategy.
- `alertEscalationPolicy`: An [AlertEscalationPolicy](#alertescalationpolicy) object defines [alert-settings](/docs/alerting-and-retries/) for Check runs. If **set**, it overrides the alert settings of all checks in the group. If **not set**, each Check uses its own alert configuration.

> When you use `testMatch` to add Checks to a group, the CLI searches for matching files using the corresponding [Check file](/docs/cli/using-check-test-match/#checkscheckmatch) as a base path.

> Note that you can configure two different `frequency` properties for API and Browser checks in a `CheckGroup` separately.
> The CLI follows a fallback logic using `Check->CheckGroup->Project` configurations.

## `CheckGroup` (deprecated)

As of CLI release v6.0 the CheckGroup construct is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. We recommend migrating to [CheckGroupV2](#checkgroupv2), which offers more intuitive behavior and better control.

In the deprecated `CheckGroup`, the properties `runParallel`, `locations`, `privateLocations`, `alertEscalationPolicy`, and `retryStrategy` were always treated as overrides. Even when not explicitly set, default values were applied and used to override the Check’s individual settings. With `CheckGroupV2`, no value means no override. If these fields are left undefined, Checks will use their own individual configuration.

Please double-check your group definitions when migrating to make sure your Check behavior stays consistent. For a full overview of what’s changing and what to watch out for, check out our [migration guide](https://feedback.checklyhq.com/changelog/checkly-groups-update-organize-checks-your-way).

## `AlertSettings`

[Alert settings](/docs/alerting-and-retries/alert-settings/#alert-settings) let you to control when and how often you will be notified when a Check starts failing, degrades or recovers.

Here’s what the configuration object looks like:

- `reminders`: Defines how many reminder notifications to send (amount) and the time interval between them in minutes (interval) while an alert is active.
- `escalationType`: Specifies the escalation strategy. Possible values include `RUN_BASED` (escalate after a number of failed runs) or `TIME_BASED` (escalate after a time threshold).
- `runBasedEscalation`: Configures run-based escalation. `failedRunThreshold` defines how many failed runs trigger escalation.
- `timeBasedEscalation`: Configures time-based escalation. `minutesFailingThreshold` defines how long a Check must be failing before escalation.
- `parallelRunFailureThreshold`: Optional. Enables escalation based on the percentage of parallel runs that fail. Use `enabled` to toggle this, and `percentage` to define the failure threshold.

```ts {title="api.check.ts"}
import { ApiCheck, RetryStrategyBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'

new ApiCheck('retrying-check', {
  name: 'Check With Retries',
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://danube-web.shop/api/books'
  }
  alertSettings: {
    reminders: {
      amount: 0,
      interval: 5
    },
    escalationType: "RUN_BASED",
    runBasedEscalation: {
      failedRunThreshold: 1
    },
    timeBasedEscalation: {
      minutesFailingThreshold: 5
    },
    parallelRunFailureThreshold: {
      enabled: false,
      percentage: 10
    }
  }
})
```

## `AlertChannel`

Alert channels let you get alert notifications when a Check fails. [Learn more about alerting in our docs](/docs/alerting/).

All alert channels share a set of common properties to define when / how they should alert derived from the abstract class
`AlertChannel`

- `sendRecovery`: A boolean if you want to receive recovery notifications.
- `sendFailure`: A boolean if you want to receive failure notifications.
- `sendDegrade`: A boolean if you want to receive degraded notifications. These only apply to API Checks.
- `sslExpiry`: A boolean if you want to receive a notification when a SSL/TLS certificate expires. This works only for API Checks.
- `sslExpiryThreshold`: A number indicating how many days before the certificate expiry date a notification will be triggered.

Alert channels are assigned to Checks and CheckGroups by instantiating a class and adding the resulting object to the
`alertChannels` array.

> Note that alert channels are only deployed to your Checkly account when referenced explicitly in the `alertChannels`
property of a Project, CheckGroup or Check.

### Using `fromId()` to reference an existing channel

You can reference an existing alert channel in your Checkly account using the `fromId()` method on any `AlertChannel`
class. When your CLI project is responsible for creating and managing alert channels, it integrates seamlessly with Checkly's deployment control mechanisms. This ensures that any changes made are thoroughly validated. 

For users with multiple Checkly CLI projects:

- Alert channels can be set up through the Checkly UI or any other method, ensuring they remain intact and unaffected by individual CLI project operations.

For users managing a single Checkly CLI project:

- The entire process of creating and subscribing to alert channels can be handled within that single project. This is made possible because the project references the logical ID of the alert channel, rather than an ID generated post-deployment.

> If you attempt to deploy a project that references alert channels which have been removed or are no longer valid, the deployment process will not proceed. This feature helps maintain the integrity and reliability of your monitoring and alerting setup.

```ts
export const emailChannel = EmailAlertChannel.fromId(20)
```

You can obtain the ID for your alert channel either from the Checkly web UI or by utilizing our [REST API](https://developers.checklyhq.com/reference/getv1alertchannels).

## `StatusPageService`

Creates a service used on status pages for providing uptime information.

```ts {title="statusPageService.check.ts"}
import { StatusPageService } from 'checkly/constructs'

new StatusPageService('apiEndpoints', {
    name: 'API Endpoints',
})
```

- `name`: Name of the service. Displayed on the status page.

[Learn more about services in our docs](/docs/status-pages/#services)

## `PrivateLocation`

Creates a Private Location, so you can deploy one or more Checkly Agents on-prem, in a VPC or any segregated network.

```ts {title="private-location.ts"}
import { PrivateLocation } from 'checkly/constructs'

export const myPrivateLocation = new PrivateLocation('private-location-1', {
  name: 'My private location',
  icon: 'squirrel',
  slugName: `my-private-location`
})
```

Use the new private location in a Check:

```ts {title="api.check.ts"}
import * as path from 'path'
import { ApiCheck, AssertionBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'
import { myPrivateLocation } from './private-location.check'

new ApiCheck('local-api-1', {
  name: 'Local API',
  activated: true,
  maxResponseTime: 10000,
  degradedResponseTime: 5000,
  privateLocations: [ myPrivateLocation ],
  request: {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'https://my-local-domain:5000/post',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'checkly'
    }),
    skipSSL: true,
    followRedirects: true,
    assertions: [
        AssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200),
    ]
  }
})
```

> Note that the `privateLocations` property on any `Check` construct directly accepts `PrivateLocation` instances if the
> instance is created within the scope of the CLI project. If you want to reference a Private Location created in a different
> project or created via the Web UI, you can pass in the `slugName` string.

- `name`: A friendly name for your private location.
- `slugName`: A valid unique slug name.
- `icon`: An icon to distinguish the location in our UI. You can pick any [Octicons](https://primer.style/design/foundations/icons) name.
- `proxyUrl`: Define a proxy for outgoing API check HTTP calls from your private location.

[Learn more about private locations in our docs](/docs/private-locations/)

## `RetryStrategy`

`RetryStrategy` objects can be used to configure retries for failed check runs.
Retry strategies can be set at the [check](#check), [check group](#checkgroup), and [project](#project) levels.
[Learn more about retry strategies](/docs/alerting-and-retries/retries/#retry-strategies).

To build `RetryStrategy` objects you should use the `RetryStrategyBuilder`, which provides helper methods for configuring retries.
As an example, you can configure a check to retry up to 4 times, in different regions, with waits of 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 90 seconds, and 120 seconds between attempts:

```ts {title="api.check.ts"}
import { ApiCheck, RetryStrategyBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'

new ApiCheck('retrying-check', {
  name: 'Check With Retries',
  retryStrategy: RetryStrategyBuilder.linearStrategy({
    baseBackoffSeconds: 30,
    maxRetries: 4,
    sameRegion: false,
  }),
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://danube-web.shop/api/books'
  }
})
```

`RetryStrategyBuilder` supports the following helper methods:

- `noRetries()`: No retries are performed.
- `fixedStrategy(options)`: A fixed time between retries, e.g. 5s, 5s, 5s etc.
- `linearStrategy(options)`: A linearly increasing time between retries, e.g. 5s, 10s, 15s, etc.
- `exponentialStrategy(options)`: An exponentially increasing time between retries, e.g. 5s, 25s, 125s (2m and 5s) etc.

For all of the methods above, the `options` argument can be used to customize the following properties:

- `baseBackoffSeconds`: The amount of time to wait before the first retry. This will also be used to calculate the wait time for subsequent retries. Defaults to 60.
- `maxRetries`: The maximum number of times to retry the check. This value should be between 1 and 10. Defaults to 2.
- `maxDurationSeconds`: The maximum amount of time to continue retrying the check. Maximum 600 seconds. Defaults to 600 seconds.
- `sameRegion`: Whether retries should be run in the same region as the initial failed check run. Defaults to `true`.

## `AlertEscalationPolicy`

`AlertEscalationPolicy` objects can be used to configure alert settings for the check runs.
Alert escalation policies can be added to [Check](#check) and [CheckGroup](#checkgroup) constructs.
[Learn more about alert settings](/docs/alerting-and-retries/alert-settings/).

To build `AlertEscalationPolicy` objects you should use the `AlertEscalationBuilder`, which provides helper methods for configuring alert settings.
As an example, you can configure an alert policy to notify you when a check run has failed twice consecutively, and with 2 reminders each 5 minutes apart.

```ts ts {title="api.check.ts"}
import { AlertEscalationBuilder, ApiCheck } from 'checkly/constructs'

new ApiCheck('alerting-check', {
  name: 'Check With Alert Policy',
  alertEscalationPolicy: AlertEscalationBuilder.runBasedEscalation(2, { interval: 2, amount: 5 }, { enabled: true, percentage: 50 }),
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://danube-web.shop/api/books'
  }
})

```

`AlertEscalationBuilder` supports the following methods:

- `runBasedEscalation(failedRuns, reminder, parallelRunFailureThreshold)`: Number of times the check has to fail consecutively to get alerted.
- `timeBasedEscalation(minutesFailing, reminder, parallelRunFailureThreshold)`:  Amount of time  (in minutes) it has to pass on failing checks to get alerted.

For all options above, the `reminders` argument can be used to configure reminders for the alert, it has the following properties:

- `interval`: Amount of time (in minutes) it has to pass to get the reminder.
