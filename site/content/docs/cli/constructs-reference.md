## `Project`

A `Project` defines core settings and defaults for the CLI and other constructs like Checks. In many cases, you can just
use set defaults for your Checks in the `checks` property and override them occasionally at the Check or CheckGroup level.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'
import { Frequency } from 'checkly/constructs'

export default defineConfig({
  projectName: 'Website Monitoring',
  logicalId: 'website-monitoring-1',
  repoUrl: 'https://github.com/acme/website',
  checks: {
    activated: true,
    muted: false,
    runtimeId: '2022.10',
    frequency: Frequency.EVERY_5M,
    locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
    tags: ['website', 'api'],
    checkMatch: '**/__checks__/*.check.ts',
    ignoreDirectoriesMatch: [],
    browserChecks: {
      frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,
      testMatch: '**/__checks__/*.spec.ts',
    },
  },
  cli: {
    runLocation: 'eu-west-1',
    privateRunLocation: 'private-dc1'
  }
})
```

- `projectName`: A friendly name for your Project.
- `logicalId`: A unique identifier for this Project. Like all logical ID's, this should be stable.
- `repoUrl`: An optional URL to a Git repository.

- `checks`: Top-level defaults for all Checks in this Project. If not overridden at the Check or CheckGroup level, these
settings apply to your Checks. Takes all [Check properties](#check)
  - `checkMatch`: A glob pattern where the CLI should look for files containing Check constructs. For more info check [the
    dedicated docs on checkMatch and testMatch](/docs/cli/using-check-test-match/)
  - `ignoreDirectoriesMatch`: An array of glob patterns which directories should be ignored by the `checkMatch` property.
  - `browserChecks`: Top-level defaults specifically for Browser Checks generated by a glob match pattern. All [Check properties](#check)
  are valid here.
    - `testMatch`: Glob pattern where the CLI looks for Playwright test files, i.e. all `.spec.ts` files. For more info check [the
dedicated docs on checkMatch and testMatch](/docs/cli/using-check-test-match/)

- `cli`: Defaults for CLI commands.
  - `runLocation`: The default run location when running `npx checkly test`.
  - `privateRunLocation`: The default private run location when running `npx checkly test`.

## `Check`

The CLI currently supports three Check types: API, Browser and Heartbeat Checks.

These Check types share properties derived from the abstract class `Check`.

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                    | Supported in                  |

| `privateLocations` | an array of [Private Locations](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/private-locations/) slugs, i.e. `['datacenter-east-1']`.        | `API`, `Browser`              |
| `activated`        | A boolean value if your Check is activated or not.                                                                             | `API`, `Browser`, `Heartbeat` |
| `muted`            | A boolean value if alert notifications from your Check are muted, i.e. not sent out.                                           | `API`, `Browser`, `Heartbeat` |
| `group`            | The `CheckGroup` object that this check is part of.                                                                            | `API`, `Browser`              |
| `alertChannels`    | An array of `AlertChannel` objects to which to send alert notifications.                                                       | `API`, `Browser`, `Heartbeat` |
| `tags`             | An array of tags to help you organize your Checks, i.e. `['product', 'api']`.                                                  | `API`, `Browser`, `Heartbeat` |
| `runtimeId`        | The ID of which [runtime](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/runtimes/specs/) to use for this Check.                               | `API`, `Browser`              |
| `testOnly`         | A boolean determining if the Check is available only when `test` runs and not included when `deploy` is executed.              | `API`, `Browser`              |
| `retryStrategy`    | A [RetryStrategy](#retrystrategy) object configuring [retries](/docs/retries-and-alerting/) for failed check runs.             | `API`, `Browser`              |
| `doubleCheck`      | (deprecated) A boolean value if Checkly should double check on failure. This option is deprecated in favor of `retryStrategy`. | `API`, `Browser`              |

> Note that most properties have sane default values and do not need to be specified.

## `ApiCheck`

API Checks are a good fit for monitoring typical HTTP based endpoints like REST APIs and GraphQL APIs, but can also be
used for form encoded payloads. The example below shows the following:

- It defines the basic Check properties like `name`, `activated` etc.
- It defines the HTTP method `POST`, `url` and the `body`
- It sets an extra header in the `headers` array.
- It sets an extra parameter in the `queryParameters` array, although you could add that to the URL directly too.
- It defines an array of assertions using the `AssertionBuilder` to assert that:
  - the HTTP response status is `200`
  - the JSON response body has a property called `name` by using the [JSON path](https://jsonpath.com/) expression `$.name`
  - the `strict-transport-security` response header's `max-age` property has a value greater than 100000.
- It runs a **setup script** and **teardown script**, which are just TypeScript files referenced from the same directory.


The file hierarchy looks as follows:

```
├── __checks__
│   ├── hello-api.check.ts
│   ├── setup.ts
│   ├── teardown.ts
```

```ts
// hello-api.check.ts

import { ApiCheck, AssertionBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'
import * as path from 'path'

new ApiCheck('hello-api-1', {
  name: 'Hello API',
  activated: true,
  setupScript: {
      entrypoint: path.join(__dirname, 'setup.ts')
  },
  tearDownScript: {
    entrypoint: path.join(__dirname, 'teardown.ts')
  },
  maxResponseTime: 10000,
  degradedResponseTime: 5000,
  request: {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'https://httpbin.org/post',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'checkly'
    }),
    skipSSL: false,
    followRedirects: true,
    headers: [
      {
        key: 'X-My-Header',
        value: 'My custom header value'
      }
    ],
    queryParameters: [
      {
        key: 'myParam',
        value: 'true'
      }
    ],
    assertions: [
        AssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200),
        AssertionBuilder.jsonBody('$.name').notEmpty(),
        AssertionBuilder.headers('strict-transport-security', 'max-age=(\\d+)').greaterThan(10000),
    ]
  }
})
```

- `setupScript`: An object with either an `entrypoint` property that points to a `.js|ts` file, or a `content` property with
raw JavaScript / TypeScript as a string. This runs before the API check is executed. Check [our docs on how to use setup and teardown scripts](/docs/api-checks/setup-teardown-scripts/).
- `tearDownScript`: An object with either an `entrypoint` property that points to a `.js|ts` file, or a `content` property with
  raw JavaScript / TypeScript as a string. This runs after the API check is executed. Check [our docs on how to use setup and teardown scripts](/docs/api-checks/setup-teardown-scripts/).
- `maxResponseTime`: The response time in milliseconds where a check should be considered failing.
- `degradedResponseTime`: The response time in milliseconds where a check should be considered degraded.
- `shouldFail`: Choose whether a failure should count as a pass. All requests with status code 400 or higher are reported as passed if set to `true`. The default behaviour if this setting is not defined is `false`.
- `request`: An object of the `Request` type. See the [`Request` reference](#request).

### `Request`

The `request` object is a mandatory part of an API check.

- `url`: A string for the target URL.
- `method`: The HTTP method as a string, i.e. `GET | POST | PUT | PATCH | HEAD | DELETE | OPTIONS`
- `body`: A string for HTTP request body.
- `bodyType`: A string indicating the type of body. Options are `JSON | FORM | RAW | GRAPHQL | NONE`. This property is mostly
for rendering the body type in the web UI and not needed in most cases using the CLI.
- `headers`: An array of `{ key: 'X-My-Header', value: 123 }` objects to define HTTP headers.
- `queryParameters`: An array of `{ key: 'my-param', value: 123 }` objects to define query parameters.
- `followRedirects`: A boolean indicating automatic following of any `30x` redirects.
- `skipSSL`: A boolean indicating whether invalid or self-signed SSL certificates should be validated.
- `basicAuth`: An object of the shape `{ username: 'admin', password: 'admin' }` to set basic auth credentials.
- `assertions`: An array of assertions to validate status codes, response bodies and much more.
See the [`AssertionBuilder` reference](#assertionbuilder).

### `AssertionBuilder`

To define `assertions` for the `request` of an `ApiCheck` you should use the `AssertionBuilder`. The `AssertionBuilder` provides a fluent
API for the otherwise slightly cryptic JSON object that the CLI passes to the Checkly API. Here are some examples:


- Asserting an HTTP status code.
```ts
AssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200)
// renders to a JSON string
"{ source: 'STATUS_CODE', regex: '', property: '', comparison: 'EQUALS', target: '200' }"
```

- Asserting a part of a JSON response body using a JSON path expression. [Learn more about using JSON path](/docs/api-checks/assertions/#json-responses-with-json-path).
```ts
AssertionBuilder.jsonBody('$.data').greaterThan(2000),
// renders to a JSON string
"{ source: 'JSON_BODY', regex: '', property: '$.data', comparison: 'GREATER_THAN', target: '2000' }"
```

- Asserting the value of a part of an HTTP response header. Note that you can pass in a regex as the second argument.
```ts
AssertionBuilder.headers('strict-transport-security', 'max-age=(\\d+)').greaterThan(10000),
// renders to a JSON string
"{ source: 'HEADERS', regex: 'max-age=(\d+)', property: 'strict-transport-security', comparison: 'GREATER_THAN', target: '100000' }"
```

The `AssertionBuilder` defines the following sources as an entry to building an assertion.

- `statusCode()`: Assert the HTTP status code for the HTTP request, e.g. `200` or `404`.
- `jsonBody(property?)`: Assert the JSON response body. Accepts a [JSON path expression](/docs/api-checks/assertions/#json-responses-with-json-path) as the `property` argument.
- `textBody()`: Assert the body as raw text.
- `headers(propery?, regex?)`: Assert a set of response headers, takes the header name as the `property` argument and a `regex` to tease out a string from the header value.
- `responseTime()`: Assert the total response time of the HTTP request.

Read more about assertions in [our docs on API check assertions](/docs/api-checks/assertions/).

## `HeartbeatCheck`

A heartbeat check is a passive check type that expects pings from an external source, such as a scheduled job on a server, at a defined interval. A ping is an HTTP request to a given endpoint URL.

You can obtain the ping URL from our [user interface](https://app.checklyhq.com/heartbeats) or the CLI output of [`checkly deploy`](/docs/cli/command-line-reference/#npx-checkly-deploy).

```ts
import { HeartbeatCheck } from 'checkly/constructs'

new HeartbeatCheck('heartbeat-check-1', {
  name: 'Send weekly newsletter job',
  period: 7,
  periodUnit: 'days',
  grace: 2,
  graceUnit: 'hours',
})
```

- `period`: The expected period of time between each ping. Between 30 seconds and 365 days.

- `periodUnit`: The unit of time for the period, the available options are `'seconds' | 'minutes' | 'hours' | 'days'`.

- `grace`: The grace period to wait for before sending an alert. Between 0 seconds and 365 days.

- `graceUnit`: The unit of time for the grace period, the available options are `'seconds' | 'minutes' | 'hours' | 'days'`.

## `BrowserCheck`

Browser Checks are based on [`@playwright/test`](https://playwright.dev/). You can just write `.spec.js|ts` files with test cases
and the Checkly CLI will pick them up and apply some default settings like a name, run locations and run frequency to turn
them into synthetic monitoring Checks.

However, you can override these global settings and configure individual Browser Checks just like all other built-in Check
types. The most important thing is to set the `code.entrypoint` property and point it to your Playwright `.spec.js|ts` file.
This property supports relative and absolute paths.

```ts
import { BrowserCheck, Frequency } from 'checkly/constructs'
import * as path from 'path'

new BrowserCheck('browser-check-1', {
  name: 'Browser check #1',
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  code: {
    entrypoint: path.join(__dirname, 'home.spec.js')
  }
})
```

- `code`: an object with either an `entrypoint` property that points to `.spec.js|ts` file, or a `content` property with
raw JavaScript / TypeScript as a string.


## `CheckGroup`

You can explicitly organize Checks in Check Groups.

This brings the following benefits:

1. Your Checks are organized in a folder in the Checkly web UI.
2. You can trigger all Checks in a group from the web UI and via a command line trigger.
3. You can manage group-level configuration like the runtime, activated & muted-state, tags and alert channels that trickle
   down to all the Checks in the group.

> Note: you will notice that managing shared configuration between Checks is very easy just using JS/TS. You might not need
Check Groups for that purpose.

#### Adding Checks to a Check Group

You can add a Check to a group in two ways.

1. By passing the `CheckGroup` object for the `group` property of a Check.
2. For Browser Checks, we allow you to use the `testMatch` glob pattern to include any `.spec.js|ts` file, without having to
   create a `BrowserCheck` construct. This works the same ast the `testMatch` glob at the Project level.

```ts
import { CheckGroup, ApiCheck, Frequency } from 'checkly/constructs'

const group = new CheckGroup('check-group-1', {
  name: 'Group',
  activated: true,
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_15M,
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  tags: ['api-group'],
  concurrency: 10,
  browserChecks: {
    frequency: Frequency.EVERY_30M,
    testMatch: '*.spec.js'
  }
})

new ApiCheck('check-group-api-check-1', {
  name: 'API check #1',
  group,
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://mac-demo-repo.vercel.app/api/hello',
  }
})
```

- `name`: A friendly name for your Check Group.
- `concurrency`: A number indicating the amount of concurrent Checks to run when a group is triggered.
- `frequency`: How often to run the Checks within the group, i.e. `Frequency.EVERY_15M` for every fifteen minutes.
- `locations`: An array of location codes where to run the Checks in the group, i.e. `['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1']`.
- `privateLocations`: An array of [Private Locations](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/private-locations/) slugs, i.e. `['datacenter-east-1']`.
- `alertChannels`: An array of `AlertChannel` objects to which to send alert notifications.
- `activated`: A boolean value if all the Checks in the group are activated.
- `muted`: A boolean value if alert notifications from the Checks in the group are muted, i.e. not sent out.
- `tags`: An array of tags. Group tags trickle down to tags on the individual Checks. i.e. `['product', 'api']`
- `runtimeId`: The ID of which [runtime](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/runtimes/specs/) to use for the Checks in the group.
- `environmentVariables`: An array of objects defining variables in the group scope, i.e. `[{ key: 'DEBUG', value: 'true' }]`
- `localSetupScript`: Any JS/TS code as a string to run before each API Check in this group.
- `localTearDownScript`: Any JS/TS code as a string to run after each API Check in this group.
- `retryStrategy`: A [RetryStrategy](#retrystrategy) object configuring [retries](/docs/retries-and-alerting/) for failed check runs.
- `apiCheckDefaults`: A set of defaults for API Checks. This should not be needed. Just compose shared defaults using JS/TS.
- `browserChecks`: A set of defaults for Browser Checks. This should not be needed. Just compose shared defaults using JS/TS.

> When adding checks to a group using `testMatch`, the CLI searches for files using the corresponding [check file](/docs/cli/using-check-test-match/#checkscheckmatch) as a base path.

> Note that you can configure two different `frequency` properties for API and Browser checks in a `CheckGroup` separatelly.
> The CLI follows a fallback logic using `Check->CheckGroup->Project` configurations.

## `AlertChannel`

Alert channels let you get alert notifications when a Check fails. [Learn more about alerting in our docs](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/alerting/)
All alert channels share a set of common properties to define when / how they should alert derived from the abstract class
`AlertChannel`

- `sendRecovery`: A boolean if you want to receive recovery notifications.
- `sendFailure`: A boolean if you want to receive failure notifications.
- `sendDegrade`: A boolean if you want to receive degraded notifications. These only apply to API Checks.
- `sslExpiry`: A boolean if you want to receive a notification when a SSL/TLS certificate expires. This works only for API Checks.
- `sslExpiryThreshold`: A number indicating how many days before the certificate expiry date a notification will be triggered.

Alert channels are assigned to Checks and CheckGroups by instantiating a class and adding the resulting object to the
`alertChannels` array.

> Note that alert channels are only deployed to your Checkly account when referenced explicitly in the `alertChannels`
property of a Project, CheckGroup or Check.

### Using `fromId()` to reference an existing channel

You can reference an existing alert channel in your Checkly account using the `fromId()` method on any `AlertChannel`
class. This enables you to share an alert channel resource between different projects living in different code repositories.

```ts
export const emailChannel = EmailAlertChannel.fromId(20)
```

You can fetch the ID for your alert channel from web UI or using our REST API.

![email channel id](/docs/images/cli/constructs_email_id@2x.jpg)


## `SMSAlertChannel`

Sends SMS notifications to phone number. Make sure to use standard international notation.

```ts
import { SmsAlertChannel } from 'checkly/constructs'

const smsChannel = new SmsAlertChannel('sms-channel-1', {
  name: 'Ops on-call',
  phoneNumber: '+31061234567890',
})
```

const emailChannel = new EmailAlertChannel('email-channel-1', {
  address: 'alerts@acme.com',
})
```

## `SlackAlertChannel`

````ts

import { SlackAlertChannel } from 'checkly/constructs'

const slackChannel = new SlackAlertChannel('slack-channel-1', {
  url: new URL('https://hooks.slack.com/services/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'),
  channel: '#ops'
})
````
[Learn more about Slack alert channels](/docs/integrations/slack/)

## `WebhookAlertChannel`

Sends a webhook to any URL. Webhooks are very powerful and have quite some options. Here is an example that send

```ts
import { WebhookAlertChannel } from 'checkly/constructs'

const webhookChannel = new WebhookAlertChannel('webhook-channel-1', {
  name: 'Pushover webhook',
  method: 'POST',
  url: new URL('https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json'),
  headers: [ { key: 'X-My-Header', value: 'myToken' }],
  template: `{
    "token":"FILL_IN_YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN_FROM_PUSHOVER",
    "user":"FILL_IN_YOUR_USER_FROM_PUSHOVER",
    "title":"{{ALERT_TITLE}}",
    "html":1,
    "priority":2,
    "retry":30,
    "expire":10800,
    "message":"{{ALERT_TYPE}} {{STARTED_AT}} ({{RESPONSE_TIME}}ms) {{RESULT_LINK}}"
  }`
})
```
- `url`: The URL where to send the webhook HTTP request.
- `method`: A string, either `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `HEAD` or `DELETE` just like an API Check.
- `template`: This is commonly a JSON body. You can use Handlebars-style template variables to add custom data to the template.
- `headers`: An array of `{ key: 'X-My-Header', value: 123 }` objects to define HTTP headers.
- `queryParameters`: An array of `{ key: 'my-param', value: 123 }` objects to define query parameters.

import { OpsgenieAlertChannel } from 'checkly/constructs'

const opsGenieChannel = new OpsgenieAlertChannel('opsgenie-channel-1', {
  name: 'My Ops Team',
  region: 'EU',
  priority: 'P1',
  apiKey: 'xxxx123abc'
})
```

- `name`: Friendly name to recognise the integration.
- `region`: A string representing the Opsgenie location, either `EU` or `US`.

const pagerdutyChannel = new PagerdutyAlertChannel('pagerduty-channel-1', {
  account: 'ACME',
  serviceName: 'ACME products',
  serviceKey: '872b9b58ff4a9n06d0dl9f20487bbqwew'
})
 ```

- `account`: The name of your Pagerduty account.
- `serviceName`: The name of your service defined in Pagerduty under which the alerts should be nested.
- `serviceKey`: The API key created by installing the Checkly integration in Pagerduty. We advise you to [install the
  Pagerduty alert channel first from our UI](https://app.checklyhq.com/alerts/settings/channels/new/pagerduty) to grab
  the `serviceKey`.

[Learn more about Pagerduty alert channels](/docs/integrations/pagerduty/)

## `MaintenanceWindow`

Creates a maintenance window that lets you schedule planned maintenance and prevents your checks from running at specific times.

```ts
import { MaintenanceWindow } from 'checkly/constructs'

new MaintenanceWindow('maintenance-window-1', {
  name: 'Programmed API maintenance',
  tags: ['production', 'api'],
  startsAt: new Date(),
  endsAt: new Date(new Date().valueOf() + (1 * 60 * 60 * 1000)), // a hour from now
  repeatInterval: 1,
  repeatUnit: 'MONTH',
  repeatEndsAt: new Date(new Date().valueOf() + (2160 * 60 * 60 * 1000)), // ~three months from now
})
```

- `name`: A friendly name for your Maintenance Window.
- `tags`: An array of tags. A list of one or more tags that filter which checks are affected by the maintenance window. i.e. `['production', 'api']`.
- `startsAt`: The start date and time of the maintenance window as an ISO 8601 timestamp `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ"` as returned by `new Date()`.
- `endsAt`: The end date and time of the maintenance window as an ISO 8601 timestamp `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ"` as returned by `new Date()`.
- `repeatInterval`: The repeat interval of the maintenance window from the first occurrence.
- `repeatUnit`: The repeat strategy for the maintenance window. This is mandatory when you specify a repeat interval.
- `repeatEndsAt`: The end date and time when the maintenance window should stop repeating  as an ISO 8601 timestamp
`"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ"` as returned by `new Date()`

[Learn more about maintenance windows in our docs](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/maintenance-windows)

## `Dashboard`

Creates a dashboard allowing you to display checks and their related metrics on a single page.

```ts
import * as path from 'path'

## `PrivateLocation`

Creates a Private Location, so you can deploy one or more Checkly Agents on-prem, in a VPC or any segregated network.

```ts
// private-location.check.ts
import { PrivateLocation } from 'checkly/constructs'

export const myPrivateLocation = new PrivateLocation('private-location-1', {
  name: 'My private location',
  icon: 'squirrel',
  slugName: `my-private-location`
})
```

Use the new private location in a Check:

```ts
import * as path from 'path'
import { ApiCheck, AssertionBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'
import { myPrivateLocation } from './private-location.check'

new ApiCheck('local-api-1', {
  name: 'Local API',
  activated: true,
  maxResponseTime: 10000,
  degradedResponseTime: 5000,
  privateLocations: [ myPrivateLocation ],
  request: {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'https://my-local-domain:5000/post',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'checkly'
    }),
    skipSSL: true,
    followRedirects: true,
    assertions: [
        AssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200),
    ]
  }
})
```
{{< info >}}
Note that the `privateLocations` property on any `Check` construct directly accepts `PrivateLocation` instances if the
instance is created within the scope of the CLI project. If you want to reference a Private Location created in a different
project or created via the Web UI, you can pass in the `slugName` string.
{{< /info >}}

- `name`: A friendly name for your private location.
- `slugName`: A valid unique slug name.
- `icon`: An icon to distinguish the location in our UI. You can pick any [Octicons](https://primer.style/design/foundations/icons) name.
- `proxyUrl`: Define a proxy for outgoing API check HTTP calls from your private location.

## `RetryStrategy`

`RetryStrategy` objects can be used to configure retries for failed check runs.
Retry strategies can be added to [Check](#check) and [CheckGroup](#checkgroup) constructs.
[Learn more about retry strategies](/docs/retries-and-alerting/).

To build `RetryStrategy` objects you should use the `RetryStrategyBuilder`, which provides helper methods for configuring retries.
As an example, you can configure a check to retry up to 4 times, in different regions, with waits of 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 90 seconds, and 120 seconds between attempts:

```ts
import { ApiCheck, RetryStrategyBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'

new ApiCheck('retrying-check', {
  name: 'Check With Retries',
  retryStrategy: RetryStrategyBuilder.linearStrategy({
    baseBackoffSeconds: 30,
    maxRetries: 4,
    sameRegion: false,
  }),
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://danube-web.shop/api/books'
  }
})
```

`RetryStrategyBuilder` supports the following helper methods:

* `fixedStrategy(options)`: A fixed time between retries, e.g. 5s, 5s, 5s etc.
* `linearStrategy(options)`: A linearly increasing time between retries, e.g. 5s, 10s, 15s, etc.
* `exponentialStrategy(options)`: An exponentially increasing time between retries, e.g. 5s, 25s, 125s (2m and 5s) etc.

For all of the methods above, the `options` argument can be used to customize the following properties:

* `baseBackoffSeconds`: The amount of time to wait before the first retry. This will also be used to calculate the wait time for subsequent retries. Defaults to 60.
* `maxRetries`: The maximum number of times to retry the check. This value should be between 1 and 10. Defaults to 2.
* `maxDurationSeconds`: The maximum amount of time to continue retrying the check. Maximum 600 seconds. Defaults to 600 seconds.
* `sameRegion`: Whether retries should be run in the same region as the initial failed check run. Defaults to `true`.
