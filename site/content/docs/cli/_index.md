The Checkly CLI and Constructs in this repo together form the basic building blocks of the Checkly Monitoring-as-Code
(MaC) workflow.

The goal of this repo and the larger MaC project is to deliver a JavaScript/TypeScript-native workflow for creating,
debugging, deploying and life cycling synthetic monitors (checks) at scale, from your code base.

This project is now in `alpha`, we aim for `beta` mid-February '23. `GA` should be before end Q1 '23.
