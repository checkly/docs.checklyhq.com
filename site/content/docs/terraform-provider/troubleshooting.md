This page covers common issues users have run into while using the Checkly Terraform provider, together with their likely root cause.

## Error: 402 payment required
You might have reached the maximum number of checks you can create on your account. Contact Checkly Support via our chat widget to talk about options. 

## Alert channel has 0 out of 0 subscribers
You might have forgotten to [subscribe checks and groups](/docs/terraform-provider/alerting#alert-channel-subscriptions) to your alert channel.

## Check seems to run from the wrong location(s)
Different things might be happening:
* If the check is part of a group, group-level settings will decide which location set is actually used to run all the checks in that group. Check again whether your check is part of a group by checking if its resource contains the `group_id` parameter.
* If the check is has "double check" enabled, and only one location configured, it will be retried from a random location chosen among all the ones available on Checkly.

## Alerts are not sent for one or more checks / the wrong channels are used
The checks you are managing could be part of a group. If so, the group-level alert channel subscriptions will override check-level ones. This is easily fixed by declaring the alert channel subscriptions at group-level only.
