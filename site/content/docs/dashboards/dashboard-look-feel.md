Dashboards have a lot of tweakable options to make them work for you in your situation.

![config public monitoring dashboard 1](/docs/images/dashboards/look_feel1.png)

- **title:** Add a title like "ACME status dash". This is separate from your custom URL or domain.
- **description:** Add a clarifying text to explain visitors what they are looking at.
- **checks:** Specify the tags of the checks you want to show on the dashboard. By default we show all checks.
    You can also choose to hide the tags from the dashboard.

- **logo:** Display your company logo (or any image) on the top left side of your dashboard.
- **logo link:** Direct visitors to your company website when they click the logo.
- **favicon:** Put the cherry on top with a custom favicon.
- **auto paginate:** Depending on your screen height and amount of checks, we can paginate through them so you have a full overview.
