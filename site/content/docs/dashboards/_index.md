> We have updated our Dashboards with a new design and Incident management. [Check out the new docs](/docs/dashboards-v2/).

Checkly dashboards are public dashboards available on every plan. Use them as a status page for your app or service  or as
a dashboard on a wall mounted TV in the office.

You can create multiple, distinct dashboards based on your plan. Edit your dashboard by clicking on
the **Dashboards** button on the Checkly default dashboard page.

An example of a dashboard is [status.checklyhq.com](https://status.checklyhq.com) as shown in the screenshot below.

## Adding checks to your dashboard

By default, if no check is specified, all checks in the account will be shown in the dashboard. If instead you want to show specific checks, this is how it's accomplished:

1. First add tags to one or more checks you would like to show. This is done by editing the check(s). 

![Tags](/docs/images/dashboards/tags.png)

You'll need to press Enter to save the tag before you save your updated check!

2. Then, edit the dashboard to include the tag:

![Filter by tags](/docs/images/dashboards/filter_by_tag.png)

Also in this step, remember to hit Enter to save the tag before you hit "Save dashboard".
