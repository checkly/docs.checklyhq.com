The example below uses the Checkly [command line trigger](/docs/cicd/triggers/) feature to run checks from your Codeship project.

## Codeship example

If you are using Codeship, you can add an extra [custom deployment script](https://documentation.codeship.com/basic/continuous-deployment/deployment-with-custom-scripts/) after your existing deployment procedure:

```bash
echo 'Deployment finished.'
curl "https://api.checklyhq.com/check-groups/4/trigger/$CHECKLY_TOKEN" > $PWD/checkly.json
if [ $(grep -c '"hasFailures":true' $PWD/checkly.json) -ne 0 ]; then exit 1; fi
```

Additionally, you will need to set the `CHECKLY_TOKEN` environment variable from the `Environment` tab in your Codeship project settings:

![Codeship Checkly Token Setting](/docs/images/cicd/codeship-param.png)

_Note: the Checkly Token is the very last part of the check's command line trigger URL._

{{< info >}}
This is a v1 integration. We are working on providing better feedback, longer runs, GitHub PR feedback and more customization options
for checks triggered directly via the API.

 The total run time of all checks cannot exceed 30 seconds or you will receive a timeout error.
