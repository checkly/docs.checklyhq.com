## Using the CLI in a CI/CD pipeline

{{< markdownpartial "/_shared/cli-basics-for-cicd.md" >}}

> Make sure to set your `CHECKLY_API_KEY` and `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` as
[secrets in your GitLab CI settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui) before you
get started.


## A Basic pipeline example

Create a new `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your repo, or add the steps and stages from the example below to your existing file.
This pipeline is "branch aware" and treats the `main` branch as the production branch. This means checks are only deployed
to Checkly after they are ran against production (after merging to `main`) and the checks passed.

```yml
image: node:latest

# define your stages to deploy your app, run tests and then deploy the tests as monitors.
stages:
  - deploy
  - checkly-test
  - checkly-deploy

# Set the necessary credentials and export variables we can use to instrument our test run. Use the ENVIRONMENT_URL
# to run your checks against staging, preview or production.
variables:
  CHECKLY_API_KEY: "$CHECKLY_API_KEY"
  CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID: "$CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID"
  CHECKLY_TEST_REPO_BRANCH: "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH"
  CHECKLY_TEST_REPO_URL:  "$CI_PROJECT_URL"

deploy-app:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "add your deployment logic here"
    # - ENVIRONMENT_URL= <add some command to extract a branch specific url to target

# Set a different environment name based on the branch you are testing against.
e2e-staging:
  stage: checkly-test
  cache:
    key:
      files:
        - package-lock.json
    paths:
      - node_modules  
  variables:
    CHECKLY_TEST_ENVIRONMENT: review/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npx checkly test --record
  except:
    - main

e2e-production:
  stage: checkly-test
  cache:
    key:
      files:
        - package-lock.json
    paths:
      - node_modules  
  variables:
    CHECKLY_TEST_ENVIRONMENT: "production"
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npx checkly test --record
  only:
    - main

monitor:
  stage: checkly-deploy
  cache:
    key:
      files:
        - package-lock.json
    paths:
      - node_modules  
  needs: ["e2e-production"]
  script:
    - npx checkly deploy --force
  only:
    - main
```

The above example creates three stages:
- **deploy**: this is where your application specific deployment logic happens
- **checkly-test**: after the deploy stage, we run the `checkly test` command. We run two different jobs based on whether
we are on the `main` branch of a different, feature branch so we can set a different environment.
- **checkly-deploy**: the last stage, that only runs on `main` is to deploy the checks to Checkly. Note that this stage
only runs when the previous `e2e-production` job is successful.

The output in the GitLab CI CI/CD -> Pipelines tab will now look similar to this:
