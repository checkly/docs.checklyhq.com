The Vercel - [Checkly native integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/checkly) moves the user and plan management of your Checkly account to Vercel. You have access to the same Hobby and Team plan as when subscribing directly on Checkly, but the management process is different. If you are new to Vercel's native integrations you can read more about them [here](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations#native-integrations).

### User management
If you are using the Vercel native integration, your Checkly users will be managed through Vercel. Members of your Vercel team can all access Checkly up to the seat limit on your selected plan. See our [pricing page](https://www.checklyhq.com/pricing/) for details on the number of seats available on your plan.

To add a new user to your Checkly account they need to be a member of your Vercel team. The user then only needs to click `Open in Checkly` to be added to your Checkly account.

### Usage and billing
You can view and adjust your selected plan from the integration product page in Vercel. Go to the [your Checkly account billing page](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/billing) and click `Visit Vercel`, select the installed product, then select `Settings`. Under `Change configuration` you can change your current plan, or change the number of pre-purchased check runs on a team plan subscription.

You can always view your recent usage under the `Usage` tab, found below `Settings` in the sidebar.

Checkly invoices will be sent to our Vercel account, and can be viewed under `Settings` and `Invoices` in Vercel.

If you have an active subscription to a paid plan, you cannot delete your integration before you have downgraded your plan to a free one. This is to ensure that you have control over your installation and can utilize features and capabilities you have paid for until the end of the subscription. If you need to delete the integration earlier, contact [support@checklyhq.com](mailto:support@checklyhq.com) for assistance.
