Triggers enable you to call a check from a CI/CD pipeline, a bash shell or programmatically in your code.

Start by creating a trigger URL from the **CI/CD** tab of your check:

![trigger monitoring checks from CI/CD](/docs/images/cicd/triggers.png)

## Calling triggers

The trigger URL can be called with a simple HTTP `GET` request.

Calling the trigger (with cURL for example) executes a **synchronous** check, e.g. the cURL request will "hang" until
the checks is finished.

For most **API checks** this should be fine and resolve within a second or so.

For **browser checks**, this could take a substantial amount of time, e.g. 10 to 30 seconds for
typical checks. Be sure to take this into account when configuring timeout setting when calling the trigger URL.

A trigger returns two possible **status codes**:

- `200 OK` means your checks and all its assertions passed successfully.
- `503 Service Unavailable` means your check failed, either on the request or the assertions.

In addition to the status code, the trigger returns a JSON response. Because the trigger URL allows direct
access to running the check without further authentication, Checkly limits the amount of information in the response
for check triggers to a `hasFailures` boolean and, for only the API checks, the `responseTime` in milliseconds.

```

{{< warning >}}
The total run time of all checks cannot exceed **30 seconds** or you will receive a timeout error.

## Optional deployment parameters

You can add the following query parameters to any trigger request. This enables you to record deployments in the Checkly
event timeline, in turn enabling you to track application performance across deploys.

| parameter         | type    | required |                                                                                                        |
|-------------------|---------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `deployment`      | Boolean | false    | Set to true to record each trigger invocation as a deployment event.                                   |
| `repository`      | String  | false    | Repository name, i.e. "checkly/backend-api"                                                            |
| `sha`             | String  | false    | Git hash, tag, version "v1.0.1" or other identifier making this deploy unique                          |
| `environmentUrl`  | String  | false    | A staging or preview URL injected as ENVIRONMENT_URL in browser checks and auto-replaced in API checks |
| `runLocation`     | String  | false    | An optional data center location where to run your triggered check. Use the shorter names here, like `eu-west-1` or `us-west-1`. Defaults to `us-east-1`. |
| `environmentName` | String  | false    | The environment name of your triggered check, i.e. "production".                                       |
| `deploymentId`    | String  | false    | The deployment id of your triggered check, i.e. "deployment-1".                                        |                                


## Example 1: Recording deployments

For example, this cURL request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.checklyhq.com/checks/<uuid>/trigger/c0hYw?deployment=true&repository=acme/customer-api&sha=v1.0.2-beta"
```

would record the following deployment on your events tab:

![deployment parameters from CI/CD](/docs/images/cicd/trigger_parameters.png)

> Note: if you want to run multiple triggers for one deployment, just provide the same `repository` and `sha` parameter on each request. We will only record one deployment.
 
## Example 2: Using the environmentUrl

By providing the `environmentUrl` parameter with a correct url to a staging or preview environment, you can effectively 
change the URL's your checks are targeting. 

For example, this cURL request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.checklyhq.com/checks/<uuid>/trigger/c0hYw?deployment=true&repository=acme/customer-api&sha=v1.0.2-beta&environmentUrl=https://staging.example.com"
```

would record the same deployment as in the first example, but would do two extra things:

1. Inject the given URL into the environment variable `ENVIRONMENT_URL` for all browser checks.
2. Automatically replace the URL in any API check.

This behaviour is exactly the same as with our GitHub integration. [Check the GitHub integration's environment URL documentation
to find out how this exactly works.](/docs/cicd/github/#using-environment-urls)
