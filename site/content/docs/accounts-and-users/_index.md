When inviting a team member to join your account you can assign one of three roles that all have different access patterns.

1. **Owner**
    - Can change the team name.
2. **Admin**
    - Can invite, edit and remove other team members.
    - Can change the account settings.
3. **Read & Write**
    - Can create, update and delete checks.
    - Can create, update and delete alert settings of individual checks.
    - Can create, update and delete maintenance windows.
4. **Read Only**
    - Look, no touch.

Only the initial account creator has the **Owner** role. You can always change any assigned roles after a teammate has
joined your team.

> Roles are staggered, so any role higher up the totem pole has all the rights of the roles below him/her.

## Transferring ownership

If you have the **Owner** role, you can transfer the ownership to another team member. Just click the "Transfer ownership"
button at the bottom of the [Members page](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/members) and follow the instructions. The owner account will be downgraded to **Admin** role.
