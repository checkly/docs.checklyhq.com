Single Sign-On (SSO) enables businesses to secure employee access across a variety of third-party services. Currently, Checkly supports the following SSO protocols:

1. [SAML](/docs/accounts-and-users/saml/)
2. [Microsoft Azure AD](/docs/accounts-and-users/microsoft-azure-ad/)

If you are interested in using Checkly with a different SSO protocol, please [reach out to Support](mailto:support@checklyhq.com).

{{< info >}}
SSO is only available for Checkly's [enterprise plans](/pricing/).
