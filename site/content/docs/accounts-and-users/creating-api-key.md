The Checkly public API uses API keys to authenticate requests. API keys are unique to the user and not tied to an account.

**Steps to create an API key:** 

1. Go to the API keys section in the [User Settings](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/user/).
2. Click **Create new API key**.
3. Enter a name for the API key in the dialog box.
4. Click **Create new API key**.
5. The new API key is shown and can be copied. Make sure to copy it immediately as it won't be shown again.

## Using an API key

Use the API key as a Bearer token in the Authorization header when calling the Checkly API, e.g.
You also need to set your target Account ID, you can find the Checkly Account ID under your [Account Settings](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/general). If you donâ€™t have access to account settings, please contact your account owner/admin.

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer my_token" -H "X-Checkly-Account: my_account_ID" https://api.checklyhq.com/v1/checks
```

## Deleting an API key

Only the user can delete an API key. To delete an API key click on the **Delete** icon in the Api Keys section of the [User Settings](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/user/). 

If you wish to revoke access of a user to an account, remove the user from the team in the [Team section of Account Settings](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/team).
