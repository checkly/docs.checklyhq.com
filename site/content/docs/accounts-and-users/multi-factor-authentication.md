You can add an extra layer of security to your account with an additional verification method, also known as multi-factor authentication, or MFA.

Checkly supports MFA using one time passwords generated by a separate authenticator app.

## Setting up multi-factor authentication
- Click on your avatar in the upper right corner and select 'User settings'.
- Toggle 'Enable multi-factor authentication'.
- Log out of your account and log back in.
- When prompted, scan the QR code using one of the supported apps:
    - Authy ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy) / [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017))
    - Auth0 Guardian ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.auth0.guardian) / [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/auth0-guardian/id1093447833))
    - Google Authenticator  ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) / [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605))

- Enter the code provided by your authenticator app.
- Record your recovery code, you can use this to log in if you temporarily lose access to your authenticator app.

From now on when logging in you will be asked to provide a one time password.

## Removing or changing MFA
- To stop using MFA, toggle the 'Enable multi-factor authentication' setting under User Settings.
