> Playwright Checks are currently in Alpha. Please join the [Slack community](https://checklycommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-2qc51mpyr-5idwVD4R4izkf5FC4CFk1A#/shared-invite/email) to get live updates on feature development and get help getting started.

With Checkly, you can convert your Playwright tests directly into scheduled monitors.

You can schedule checks from different locations and trigger alerts for your team to act on when a critical flow or API fails in your product.

## What's a Playwright Check?

A Playwright check offers all of Playwright's features, natively:

* Dependencies between tests or projects â†’ `projects`, `dependencies`, `globalSetup`, `globalTeardown`, reused `StorageState`, `test.beforeEach`...
* Test level retries.
* Automatic flagging of flaky tests when passed on retry.
* Fake media access: whether it's a QR in a video you are parsing or access to a microphone, you got it.
* Control over traces, video and screenshots generation.
* Multiple browsers and viewports: Chrome, Firefox, Webkit, Mobile Chrome.

On top of these, a Playwright Check provides:

* Custom code dependencies, read directly from your `package.json` file.
* [World-wide locations](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/monitoring/global-locations/) to run your check from.
* Alerts to your preferred channel: Slack, Incident.io...
  
## Before you begin

What you need:

* A checkly account
* A repository using Playwright for E2E tests
  * It should include a playwright configuration file.
  
## Steps

**1. Install the Checkly CLI using the alpha version:**

The alpha version gets updated daily with new improvements. You can follow updates in the [Slack community](https://checklycommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-2qc51mpyr-5idwVD4R4izkf5FC4CFk1A#/shared-invite/email).

  ```bash {title="Terminal"}
  npm install -D checkly@pwt-alpha
  ```

**2. [Optional] If you're using TypeScript and Node < 22.**

  If you're using TypeScript and a Node.js version less than 22, install the dev dependencies [`ts-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) and [`typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript).

  ```bash {title="Terminal"}
  npm i --save-dev ts-node typescript
  ```

**3. Test and create a monitor with all your tests.**

  From inside your repository's source code directory, run:

  ```bash {title="Terminal"}
  npx checkly test --record
  ```
  
  This will create a test session with all your tests. You'll get a Checkly URL where you can see the test results.
  In your repository, a `checkly.config.ts/js` is automatically created, configured to run a single Playwright Check containing all your tests.

**4. Cherry-pick which tests should become checks**

Of course, you can now run `npx checkly deploy` and have a big monitor that checks your whole suite.

It's likely only some tagged tests or Playwright projects need to become monitors. You can now update your `checkly.config.ts/js` file to select the tests to become individual monitors, with their own schedule, location and configuration.

Here's a fully working example. Adjust the `pwProjects` and `pwTags` to ones that exist in your code.

  ```typescript {title="checkly.config.ts/js"}
  // checkly.config.ts
  import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'
  import { Frequency } from 'checkly/constructs'

  export default defineConfig({
    projectName: 'Cool Website Checks',
    logicalId: 'cool-website-monitoring',
    repoUrl: 'https://github.com/acme/website',
    checks: {
      playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts', //specify a custom playwright config file here
      playwrightChecks: [
        {
          /* Create a check that runs the chromium pw project 
          every 5 mins in EU west region */
          name: 'Chromium-projects',
          pwProjects: 'chromium', // Reference the project in your playwright.config.ts
          frequency: Frequency.EVERY_5M, // set your ideal frequency
          locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'], // add your locations
        },
        {
          /* Create a check that runs the critical tagged tests 
          every 10 mins in EU west region */
          name: 'Critical-tagged',
          pwTags: 'critical', // Reference an existing tag in your tests
          frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,  // set your ideal frequency
          locations: ['eu-west-1'],
        },
      ],
    },
    /* The default location to use when running npx checkly test */
    cli: {
      runLocation: 'eu-west-1',
      retries: 0, // full test retries, when running npx checkly test
    },
  })
  ```

**5. Test and deploy your updated monitors.**

Now, you can test and deploy the individual monitors that reference existing playwright tags or projects in your repository.

  ```bash {title="Terminal"}
  npx checkly test --record

  npx checkly deploy
  ```
