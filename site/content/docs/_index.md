Checkly gives you code-first synthetic monitoring for modern DevOps. Monitor your APIs and apps at a fraction of the 
price of legacy providers. Powered by Monitoring as Code and Playwright.

## Get started with monitoring as code

Get started with monitoring as code by picking the right integration for your team. We recommend using the **Checkly CLI**
for the full code, test and deploy workflow.
