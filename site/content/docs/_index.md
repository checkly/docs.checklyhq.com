Start with monitoring your key webapp flows, your backend API's and set up alerting, so you get a notification when things
break or slow down.

## Adopt The Monitoring As Code Workflow

Checkly offers a lot of power and perks to modern developers and DevOps teams to manage their Checks and monitoring setup from their code base. We call it "monitoring as code".
