Learn how to use Checkly to monitor your vital frontend webapp transactions and backend API's. Our docs cover everything
from initial setup, scripting with extensive JavaScript examples to alerting and integrations.

## Getting started: monitoring & alerting basics

Start with monitoring your key webapp flows, your backend API's and set up alerting, so you get a notification when things
break or slow down.

## Adopt The Monitoring As Code Workflow

Checkly offers a lot of power and perks to modern developers and DevOps teams to manage their Checks and monitoring setup from their code base. We call it "monitoring as code".
