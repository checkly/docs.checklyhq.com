Single Sign-On (SSO) enables businesses to secure employee access across a variety of third-party services. Currently, Checkly supports the following SSO protocols:

1. [SAML](/docs/single-sign-on/saml)
2. [Microsoft Azure AD](/docs/single-sign-on/microsoft-azure-ad)

If you are interested in using Checkly with a different SSO protocol, please [reach out to Support](mailto:support@checklyhq.com).

> SSO is only available for Checkly's [enterprise plans](/pricing).
