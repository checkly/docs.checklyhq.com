Checkly reserves the right to block, remove or otherwise disable any Checks that are not created for the intented
purpose of monitoring web applications and sites. This means we actively keep an eye out for behavior such as:

- Mining cryptocurrencies
- Vandalism (blocking / waiting scripts with no purpose)
- Overuse / spamming the interactive script runner
- Pinging 3rd party systems for the purposes of evading fair usage policies and / or circumventing typical hybernation and
"scale to zero"-rules.

Checkly uses multiple mitigating techniques to make sure this type of behaviour and traffic is flagged and dealt with as
soon as possible. If you have any questions about this, please contact us at support@checklyhq.com
