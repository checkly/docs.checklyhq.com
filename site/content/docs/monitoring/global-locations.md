You can configure your run checks to run from an ever growing amount of global locations. Leveraging global infrastructure allows us to measure what the user experience is in different parts of the world.

We use [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) to host our check runner infrastructure and follow the opening of new datacenter locations as close a possible, i.e. if  a new location opens up, Checkly will be there very soon.

Current locations in Checkly are
