With the reporting dashboard, you can get an overview of all your checks, including `average`, `p95`, and `p99`, response times, as well as the success ratio and more. You can also export this data to a CSV for further processing by any other tools.

## Overview

When navigating to the reporting dashboard, you will see an overview screen with a list of your first 15 checks.

Here you can use the toolbar to filter / sort by the following metrics:

- Date Range
- Check Type
- Check Tags
- Check Group Tags
- Name (ASC / DESC)
- Check Type (ASC / DESC)

## Graphs

Clicking on a check will open a graph of the **response times** and **success ratio**. These graphs are tied to the date range selected in the toolbar above.

> The graph _x-axis_ granularity will be adjusted according to the size of the data range that you selected using the date picker, as follows:
> * Up to **two weeks**, data will be grouped **hourly**.
> * Up to **6 months**, data will be grouped **daily**.
> * Up to **24 months**, data will be grouped **weekly**.
> * Up to **48 months**, data will be grouped **monthly**.
> * From that point onwards, data will be grouped **yearly**.

In the **response time** graph, all three metrics (`average`, `p95`, `p99`) are shown by default. However, you can individually toggle these on and off by clicking on the pills with their respective names to the right of the graph.

## CSV Export

In the reporting overview, you can export all available statistics to a CSV. Select the date range for which you'd like to export statistics, and then click **Download as CSV** on the right side of the toolbar. The generated CSV file will include the following columns/fields:

- Name
- Check ID
- Check Type
- Success Ratio
- Response Time (`Average`)
- Response Time (`P95`)
- Response Time (`P99`)
- Check Tags

Remember these statistics, like success ratio and response times, are calculated based upon the selected date range. By default, this is set to "**Last 24 Hours**".
