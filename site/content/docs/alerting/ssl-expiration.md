An expired SSL certificate can cause havoc to sites and APIs. Checkly performs a daily check on your certificate and can 
alert you up to 30 days before your certificate expires. All alert channels (e-mail, SMS, OpsGenie, Webhook etc.) can be used for this alert.

Simply create or pick an existing alert channel that your check subscribes to and enable *SSL certificate expiration* and 
set the day threshold to your preference. If you don't have your alert channels set up yet, see [Alert Channels](/docs/alerting/alert-channels/).

Some tips on using SSL alerts

- You can create specific alert channels for certificate expirations and subscribe all checks/groups to that channel.
- You can create multiple alert channels with different thresholds if you want to be alerted at multiple thresholds.

## API checks
The domain for the certificate is parsed from the `URL` in the HTTP request settings so it does not require any setup.

### Getting `Error: unable to verify the first certificate`
If prompted with this error, the usual cause is the certificate chain of the given website being incomplete. This will 
not happen with a browser check, because the browser will complete the certificate chain on its own. When running an API check, 
though, no browser is involved - therefore the error takes place. You can use an online SSL checker 
(e.g.: [SSLHopper](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html)) to help you diagnose issues with your certificate.

## Browser checks
Since browser checks can connect to multiple domains, you need to set the SSL certificate domain to receive certificate alerts for them.
