Webhooks allow you to POST custom payloads to any endpoint in your own infrastructure or a third party provider. In a
nutshell, you can:

- Create a **custom URL** by adding in authentication tokens or other secrets.
- Create a **custom payload body** using any environment variables and specific instance variables per event. Note: that means that if you are attaching the webhook to a Group, you will be able to access Group-level variables, too.
- **Debug and test the webhook** in the editor by sending test messages.

## Using variables

![webhook jira example](/docs/images/alerting/webhook-jira.png)

The example above shows a webhook configured to create a Jira ticket on each event. Notice the following:

- We use the variable `JIRA_INSTANCE_URL` in the URL. We previously stored this variable in the [environment variables section](https://app.checklyhq.com/environment-variables).
- We use the variable `CHECK_ID` in the payload. This is one of many event-based variables that will change with each call. See below for the complete list.

In both cases we use the familiar Handlebars templating braces, i.e. `{{ }}` to insert the variable.

{{<info >}}
To avoid encoding, you can access your environment variables with triple brackets, i.e. `{{{USER_API_KEY}}}`
{{</info >}}

You can use the following event-related variables in both URL and payload.

| Variable            | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CHECK_NAME`        | Full name of the check                                       |
| `CHECK_ID`          | The UUID of the check                                        |
| `CHECK_TYPE`        | The check type, i.e. API or BROWSER.                         |
| `ALERT_TITLE`       | Human readable title, e.g. 'Check "My API check" has failed' |
| `ALERT_TYPE`        | Type of alert, either "ALERT_FAIL", "ALERT_RECOVERY", "ALERT_DEGRADED" or  "ALERT_DEGRADED_RECOVERY" |
| `CHECK_RESULT_ID`   | The UUID of the result that triggered this message           |
| `RESPONSE_TIME`     | The reported response time for this result                   |
| `API_CHECK_RESPONSE_STATUS_CODE`     | The response status code, e.g. 200. Only populated for API checks.                  |
| `API_CHECK_RESPONSE_STATUS_TEXT`     | The response status text, e.g. "OK". Only populated for API checks.                  |
| `RUN_LOCATION`      | The location where the check ran, i.e. "N. California"       |
| `RESULT_LINK`       | The full link to the check result                            |
| `SSL_DAYS_REMAINING`| How many days remain on the SSL certificate. For ALERT_SSL only.|
| `SSL_CHECK_DOMAIN`  | The domain of the SSL certificate. For ALERT_SSL only.       |
| `STARTED_AT`        | The ISO timestamp from when this check run started           |
| `TAGS`              | An array of tags assigned to the check. Have a look at our Opsgenie example below on how to render this to a JSON array. |
| `GROUP_NAME`        | The name of the group, if the check belongs to one.          |

## Using Handlebars helpers

We've extended the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templating system with some handy helpers to make our webhooks
even more powerful.

{{< markdownpartial "_shared/handlebars-helpers.md" >}}

You can also use conditional helpers like `{{#eq}}` statements. Here is an example:

```json
{
  "message": "Check is {{#eq ALERT_TYPE 'ALERT_FAILURE'}}DOWN{{/eq}} {{#eq ALERT_TYPE 'ALERT_RECOVERY'}}UP{{/eq}}"
}
```

The above webhook body uses the `{{#eq}}` helper to execute the logic

*If the ALERT_TYPE variable equals 'ALERT_FAILURE', print 'DOWN', if it equals 'ALERT_RECOVERY' print 'UP'*

So in the case of a failure event, the body would render to:

```json
{
  "message": "Check is DOWN"
}
```

Two clear benefits here:
- You only need to create one webhook to inform a 3rd party system.
- You can translate Checkly terms to your 3rd party tool's term for the same concept, i.e. the "up status" of a check.

You can find the [full list of helpers in the README.md file](https://github.com/checkly/handlebars) of the underlying library we are using.

## Webhook secrets

You can validate each webhook we deliver to your endpoint(s). Using the optional webhook secret, you can:

1. Check if the webhook was sent by Checkly.
2. Check if the payload was not altered in any way during transmission.

When you create a webhook secret, we proceed to use that secret token to cryptographically sign the webhook payload using
the SHA256 hash algorithm. We add the resulting hash to the HTTP header `x-checkly-signature` on each webhook.

On the receiving end, you can then use the value of the `x-checkly-signature` header to assert the validity and authenticity
of the webhook and its payload.

Have a look at the code examples below on how to use the header and your favourite web framework.

{{< tabs "webhook_secret_example_code" >}}
{{< tab "Node.js" >}}

```javascript
// We store the webhook secret in an environment variable called CHECKLY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
const app = require('express')();
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const crypto = require('crypto');

function isVerifiedPayload (payload, signature) {
  const secret = process.env.CHECKLY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)
  const digest = hmac.update(payload).digest('hex')
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(digest), Buffer.from(signature))
}

app.post('/webhook', bodyParser.json({ type: 'application/json' }), (request, response) => {

  const signature = request.headers['x-checkly-signature'];
  const payload = JSON.stringify(request.body)

  if (isVerifiedPayload(payload, signature)) {
    console.log('Signature is valid')
    response.status(200).send();
  } else {
    console.error('Signature does not match')
    response.status(400).send();
  }
});

app.listen(4242, () => console.log('Running on port 4242'));
```

  payload = request.body.read
  digest = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(OpenSSL::Digest.new('sha256'), ENV['CHECKLY_WEBHOOK_SECRET'], payload)

  if Rack::Utils.secure_compare(digest, signature)  	
    status 200
    return
  else
    status 400
    return
  end

    if not hmac.compare_digest(mac.hexdigest(), signature):
        return HttpResponseBadRequest()

    return HttpResponse()
```

## Webhook retries

Checkly will retry your webhook up to **5 times** if we get an HTTP response higher than 399, e.g. a 404 or 503. Each retry
is backed off 20 seconds for a total retry period of `5 * 20 = 100 seconds`.

This means that for checks on a 1 minute schedule, there is a potential overlap between a failure alert and recovery alert. For this
reason every webhook we send has a timestamp in the `x-checkly-timestamp` header. You can use this timestamp on the receiving
end to ignore any webhooks that come in "late".

## Webhook examples

The following examples give an idea how to integrate Checkly with 3rd party alerting and issue tracking systems.

## OpsGenie

You can create an <a href="https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/alert-api" target="_blank">OpsGenie</a> alert by POST-ing the following body

```
{
  "message": "{{ALERT_TITLE}}",
  "description": "{{ALERT_TYPE}} <br>{{STARTED_AT}} ({{RESPONSE_TIME}}ms) <br>{{RESULT_LINK}}",
  "tags": [{{#each TAGS}} "{{this}}" {{#unless @last}},{{/unless}} {{/each}}]
}
```

to the OpsGenie `alerts` API endpoint

```
https://{{OPSGENIE_API_KEY}}@api.opsgenie.com/v2/alerts
```

Or you can add the OpsGenie API key in the headers, e.g.

```
Authorization: GenieKey {{OPSGENIE_API_KEY}}
```

This is an example of a full alert body:

```json
{
  "message": "{{ALERT_TITLE}}",
  "description": "{{ALERT_TYPE}}: {{CHECK_NAME}} <br>{{STARTED_AT}} ({{RESPONSE_TIME}}ms) <br>{{RESULT_LINK}}",
  "responders": [
        {
            "id":"4513b7ea-3b91-438f-b7e4-e3e54af9147c",
            "type":"team"
        }
  ],
  "tags": ["Critical", "Production"],
  "priority":"P1",
  "note": "Location: {{RUN_LOCATION}}"
}
```

In case you would like different teams to be responsible for different Check Groups, you could add a `CHECK_GROUP_TEAM` variable with a different value for each Group, then modify the above snippet with the following:

```json
"responders": [
      {
          "id":"{{CHECK_GROUP_TEAM}}",
          "type":"team"
      }
]
```

## PagerDuty

Given an existing service on your PagerDuty account, create an incident for it by posting the following body

```json
{
  "incident": {
    "type": "incident",
    "title": "{{ALERT_TITLE}}",
    "service": {
      "id": "<YOUR_SERVICE_ID_FROM_PAGERDUTY>",
      "type": "service_reference"
    },
    "body": {
      "type": "incident_body",
      "details": "Check {{CHECK_NAME}} with ID {{CHECK_ID}} has failed from location {{RUN_LOCATION}}. See check result for details: {{RESULT_LINK}}"
    }
  }
}
```

to `https://api.pagerduty.com/incidents`. You will need to set the following headers:

![pagerduty incident headers](/docs/images/alerting/webhook-pagerduty-headers.png)

## Pushover

Send a message using [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) by posting this body:

```json
{
  "token":"YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN_FROM_PUSHOVER",
  "user":"YOUR_USER_FROM_PUSHOVER",
  "title":"{{ALERT_TITLE}}",
  "html":1,
  "priority":2,
  "retry":30,
  "expire":10800,
  "message":"{{ALERT_TYPE}} <br>{{STARTED_AT}} ({{RESPONSE_TIME}}ms) <br>{{RESULT_LINK}}"
}
```


## Trello

You can create a [Trello](https://trello.com) card using just the URL and no payload:

```
https://api.trello.com/1/cards?idList=5b28c04aed47522097be8bc4&key={{TRELLO_KEY}}&token={{TRELLO_TOKEN}}&name={{CHECK_NAME}}
```

## SSL alert

You can send your SSL alerts using webhooks. Using the following body:

```json
{
  "message": "{{ALERT_TITLE}}",
  "link":"{{RESULT_LINK}}"
}
```

Will yield the following output, where we customize the `ALERT_TITLE` to include the domain and the days remaining till your
certificate expires.

```json
{
  "message": "The SSL certificate for api.checklyhq.com will expire in 14 days",
  "link": "http://app-test.checklyhq.com/checks/08437f9c-df8c-45ed-975a-a3f9e24d626d"
}
```
## Twilio

You can configure a webhook to POST to a JavaScript snippet running in a [Twilio Function](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions). This code receives the Checkly webhook JSON, then triggers a Twilio "Flow execution":

```js
//"From" is the sender phone number
//"To" is the receiver phone number
exports.handler = async function (context, event, callback) {
  const { From, To, Event, Link } = event;
  const client = context.getTwilioClient();
  try {
    const execution = await client.studio.flows(FLOW_SID)
      .executions
      .create({ to: To, from: From, parameters: { Event, Link } })
    console.log(`Created execution ${execution.sid}`);
    return callback(null, "OK");
  } catch (error) {
    return callback(error);
  }
};
```

## Jira

A webhook can be used to create a new issue on Jira via the [Jira API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/intro/), for example in the case of a previously passing check that switches to failing state.

We will be creating a POST request to `{{JIRA_INSTANCE_URL}}/rest/api/2/issue`, where the content of your `JIRA_INSTANCE_URL` environment variable would look something like `https://your-jira-instance-name.atlassian.net`.

The required headers will be:

```
Authorization: <YOUR_JIRA_BASIC_AUTH>
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

An example body could look as follows:

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "description": "{{RESULT_LINK}}",
    "issuetype": {
      "id": "10001" // your Jira issue type id
    },
    "labels": [
      "needs_investigation"
    ],
    "project": {
      "key": "ABC" // your Jira project key
    },
    "summary": "{{ALERT_TITLE}}"
  }
}
```
