4. Enter a name of your choosing for the alert channel, together with the Coralogix URL (ex. `https://ingress.coralogix.com/logs/rest/singles`, note that the API endpoint will change if your Coralogix instance is in Europe or Asia) and the API key you copied from Coralogix. Make sure that the right checks are subscribing to the channel and that the `Send when` rules are correctly set, then hit `Save Coralogix Webhook`.
