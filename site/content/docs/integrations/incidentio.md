Checkly integrates with [Incident.io](https://incident.io/) to monitor your alerts and create incidents in your Incident.io installation. Let's get started!

1. Log in to Incident.io and navigate to **Alerts > Routing** and create an HTTP alert source.

2. Next, copy the generated "URL" and the API key from "Headers".

4. Enter a name of your choosing for the alert channel, together with the Incident.io URL (ex. `https://api.incident.io/v2/alert_events/http/{alert_source_config_id}`), and the API key you copied from Incident.io. Make sure that the right checks are subscribing to the channel and that the **Send when** rules are correctly set, then hit **Save Incident.io Webhook**.

5. Once one of your selected checks triggers an alert you are going to see it on your Incident.io account.
