The [Checkly Pulumi provider](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/checkly/) enables declaring your monitoring setup as code using [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/).

## Getting started

Learn how to create, configure and sync your checks by following this getting started guide.

### Pulumi CLI setup

Before getting started and writing your monitoring setup in code, you have to set up Pulumi and its CLI. [Create a new Pulumi account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup) and [install the Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/).

The `pulumi` command should then be available in your environment.

```
$ pulumi
pulumi
Pulumi - Modern Infrastructure as Code

To begin working with Pulumi, run the `pulumi new` command:
  $ pulumi new

This will prompt you to create a new project for your cloud and language of choice.
...
...
```

Create and copy a new personal access token in your Pulumi account at [app.pulumi.com/account/tokens](https://app.pulumi.com/account/tokens).

![Pulumi access token configuration screen showing a newly created token](/docs/images/integrations/pulumi/pulumi-access-token.png)

Run `pulumi login` and provide the token.

```
$ pulumi login
Manage your Pulumi stacks by logging in.
Run `pulumi login --help` for alternative login options.
Enter your access token from https://app.pulumi.com/account/tokens
    or hit <ENTER> to log in using your browser:
```

The CLI's `whoiam` command should return your username after a successful login.

```
$ pulumi whoami
YOUR_USER_NAME
```

Now you're ready to create a new Pulumi project and start setting up your Checkly infrastructure.

### Create a new Pulumi project

Create a new directory for your Pulumi project and navigate into it.

```
$ mkdir new-pulumi-checkly-project && cd $_
```

Initialize a new Pulumi project with `pulumi new` and choose the minimal JavaScript template (`javascript`).

```
$ pulumi new javascript
This command will walk you through creating a new Pulumi project.

Enter a value or leave blank to accept the (default), and press <ENTER>.
Press ^C at any time to quit.

project name: (new-pulumi-checkly-project)
project description: (A minimal JavaScript Pulumi program)
Created project 'new-pulumi-checkly-project'

Please enter your desired stack name.
To create a stack in an organization, use the format <org-name>/<stack-name> (e.g. `acmecorp/dev`).
stack name: (dev)
Created stack 'dev'

Your new project is ready to go! ✨

To perform an initial deployment, run 'pulumi up'
```

Inspect the created files by running `ls` and make sure that a `Pulumi.yaml`, `package.json` and `index.js` file are available.

```
$ ls
Pulumi.yaml       node_modules      package.json
index.js          package-lock.json
```

### Define your Checkly account ID and API key

To interact with [the underlying Checkly API](https://developers.checklyhq.com/reference/authentication), provide your Checkly account ID and API key by defining those in your environment.

Your account ID is accessible at [app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/general](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/general).

![Checkly account settings showing the account ID](/docs/images/integrations/pulumi/pulumi-account-id.png)

```
export CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID=xxx
```

Create a new API key at [app.checklyhq.com/settings/user/api-keys](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/user/api-keys).

![Checkly api key section showing a newly created API key](/docs/images/integrations/pulumi/pulumi-api-key.png)

```
export CHECKLY_API_KEY=cu_xxx
```

Test that both values are available in your environment.

```
$ echo $CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID
xxx

$ echo $CHECKLY_API_KEY
cu_xxx
```

If you prefer storing your configuration alongside your Pulumi stack for easy multi-user access, use `pulumi config set`.

```sh
pulumi config set checkly:apiKey cu_xxx --secret
pulumi config set checkly:accountId xxx
```

### Install the Checkly Pulumi Provider

Install the Checkly Pulumi provider (`@checkly/pulumi`) with `yarn` or `npm` to integrate it in your new project.

```
$ npm install @checkly/pulumi
$ yarn add @checkly/pulumi
```

Open `index.js` and require it on top of the file.

```js
const checkly = require('@checkly/pulumi')
```

The exported `checkly` object provides resources such as `AlertChannel`, `Check`, and `CheckGroup`, enabling you to define and configure your entire Checkly monitoring setup in code.

Add the following Check definition examples to the `index.js`.

### Examples

#### How to create your first API check

```js
new checkly.Check('my-api-check', {
  name: 'Public SpaceX API',
  activated: true,
  frequency: 10,
  type: 'API',
  locations: ['eu-west-1', 'us-west-2'],
  tags: ['pulumi'],
  degradedResponseTime: 5000,
  maxResponseTime: 15000,
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://api.spacexdata.com/v3',
    assertions: [
      {
        source: 'STATUS_CODE',
        comparison: 'EQUALS',
        target: '200',
      },
      {
        source: 'JSON_BODY',
        property: '$.project_name',
        comparison: 'EQUALS',
        target: 'SpaceX-API',
      },
    ],
  },
  useGlobalAlertSettings: true,
})
```

#### How to create your first Browser check

```javascript {title="browser-check.js"}
new checkly.Check('my-browser-check-pulumi', {
  name: 'Google.com Playwright check',
  activated: true,
  frequency: 10,
  type: 'BROWSER',
  script: `
  const { expect, test } = require('@playwright/test')

  test('visit page and take screenshot', async ({ page }) => {
    const response = await page.goto('https://checklyhq.com')

    expect(response.status()).toBeLessThan(400)

    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.jpg' })
  })`,
  locations: ['eu-west-1', 'us-west-2'],
  tags: ['pulumi'],
})
```

#### How to create your first HTTP check

```javascript {title="http-check.js"}
new checkly.HttpCheck('my-http-check', {
  name: 'Example HTTP check',
  activated: true,
  frequency: 10,
  useGlobalAlertSettings: true,
  locations: ['us-west-1'],
  degradedResponseTime: 5000,
  maxResponseTime: 10000,
  tags: ['pulumi'],
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://httpbin.org/get',
    assertions: [
      {
        source: 'STATUS_CODE',
        comparison: 'EQUALS',
        target: '200',
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

#### How to create your first TCP check

```javascript {title="tcp-check.js"}
new checkly.TcpCheck('my-tcp-check', {
  name: 'Example TCP check',
  activated: true,
  shouldFail: false,
  frequency: 10,
  useGlobalAlertSettings: true,
  locations: ['us-west-1'],
  degradedResponseTime: 3000,
  maxResponseTime: 5000,
  tags: ['pulumi'],
  request: {
    hostname: 'api.checklyhq.com',
    port: 80,
  },
});
```

For detailed documentation on TCP checks, refer to the [Pulumi Checkly TCP Check API docs](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/checkly/api-docs/tcpcheck/).

### Creating checks and applying changes

Your `index.js` file should now include instructions to create one API and one Browser check.

Initialize a deployment and apply your changes by running `pulumi up`.

```
$ pulumi up

> [!WARNING]
> Checkly resources should be managed _either_ through Pulumi _or_ the Checkly UI, not both. Modifying Pulumi-managed resources via the UI, and vice-versa, is likely to cause issues.
