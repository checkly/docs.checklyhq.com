Checkly integrates with [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/free) and can 
deliver failure, degradation, and recovery messages to any channel in any team. You can add as many Teams channels as you wish.
To enable the MS Teams alert channel, take the following steps:

1. First, create an **Incoming Webhook**. Log in to your MS Teams account, go to Apps and search for *incoming webhook*.

    save the integration by clicking "Done".

6. Give the alert channel a name and **paste the URL** in the dedicated URL input field. You can now also tweak
which alerts you want to be notified of and which checks or check groups should be subscribed to this channel.

   > variables. Just click the "Edit payload" button and reference the "Help & variables tab".

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated Checkly with Microsoft Teams!
