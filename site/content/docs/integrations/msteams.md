Checkly integrates with [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/free) and can 
deliver failure, degradation, and recovery messages to any channel in any team. You can add as many Teams channels as you wish.
To enable the MS Teams alert channel, take the following steps:

1. First, create a **Workflow**. Log in to your MS Teams account, go to Apps and search for *workflows*.

2. Open the *Workflows* app, go to *Create* and select the **Post to a channel when a webhook request is received** template, name your workflow, and press "Next".

6. Give the alert channel a name and **paste the URL** in the dedicated URL input field. You can now also tweak
which alerts you want to be notified of and which checks or check groups should be subscribed to this channel.

   ![setup checkly msteams integration step 6](/docs/images/integrations/msteams/msteams_step6.png)

7. Save your alert channel. The next time checks subscribed to this channel triggers an alert, the integration will post a message to the configured Channel. 
Below is an example of an alert message using the default configuration.

   > Note that we provide a preconfigured message payload but you are free to edit the payload and add more or different
   > variables. Just click the "Edit payload" button and reference the "Help & variables tab".

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated Checkly with Microsoft Teams!
