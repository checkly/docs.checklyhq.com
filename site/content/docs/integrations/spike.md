Checkly integrates with [Spike.sh](https://spike.sh) and can
deliver failure, degradation, and recovery messages to any service in your Spike.sh dashboard.

1. First, add a new **Integration**. Log in to Spike.sh and go to "Integrations".

   ![setup checkly spikesh step 1](/docs/images/integrations/spikesh/spike_step1_frame.png)

2. Select "New Integration", and then choose **Checkly** in the list of available Integrations. Press "Next" to continue on to set it up.

   ![setup checkly spikesh step 2](/docs/images/integrations/spikesh/spike_step2_frame.png)

3. On the "Add Integration" page, you can fill in the details of your Checkly integration, like its name, the Spike.sh service to which it should be tied, escalation policy, and more. When you're done, hit **Add integration**.

4. You will now be taken to the Integration overview screen where you can view any activity being generated by this integration. The important part for us is gathering the Webhook URL. So click on **Copy Webhook** to copy the Webhook URL to your clipboard.

5. Next, log in to Checkly and navigate to [Alert Settings](https://app.checklyhq.com/alert-settings).
   Click the "Add more channels" button, find Spike.sh on the list, and click "Add channel".

   ![setup checkly spikesh step 5](/docs/images/integrations/spikesh/spike_step5_frame.png)

4. Give the alert channel a name and **paste the Webhook URL** into the URL field. You can now also tweak
   which alerts you want to be notified of and which checks or check groups should be attached to your Spike.sh service.

   ![setup checkly spikesh step 6](/docs/images/integrations/spikesh/spike_step6_frame.png)

   > Note that we provide a preconfigured message payload but you are free to edit the payload and add more or different
   > variables. Just click the "Edit payload" button and reference the "Help & variables tab".

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated Checkly with Spike.sh!
