Checkly allows you to use JavaScript code in your [Browser checks](/docs/browser-checks) and in the optional 
[setup & teardown scripts](/docs/api-checks/setup-teardown-scripts/) you can add to your API checks.

This JavaScript code executes in a runtime environment that is managed by Checkly. This environment has access to specific 
Node.js versions and NPM packages, like the "latest Playwright version on Node 14". We call these environments **runtimes**.

## Using runtimes

It's pretty easy. You don't have to do anything most of the time.

1. View all the available runtimes on the [runtimes tab in the account section](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/runtimes). See the screenshot below.
2. There is always one runtime marked as **active**. This is the runtime all checks use, unless you decide to override this at the check or group level.
4. Runtimes have a simple `YYYY.MM` name, e.g. `2021.06` Newer dates hold newer dependencies.   
3. Pick the runtime you want and click "Save settings". This runtime now applies to all of your checks and any new checks you create.

Note that one runtime version, e.g. `2021.6` holds all dependencies for all check types. There is no separate runtime for
different types of checks.

## Overriding runtimes for specific checks

Before updating your Checkly account to a new runtime, you can enable a newer runtime just for one check or check group.
This is a very powerful way to make sure your checks are compatible with a new runtime.

You can:

- Select a specific runtime in the **Browser check** editor.
- Select a specific runtime in the "Setup & teardown" tab for each **API check**.
- Select a specific runtime on the "Runtimes" tab for each **check group**.

> Overriding the global, account level runtime for a handful of checks is **the recommended way to check for any compatibility issues**
 before committing to a new, global runtime. Note the hierarchy: **check** runtime trumps **group** runtime trumps **global account** runtime.
 
## How we update and release new runtimes

We ship new runtimes with a regular cadence. This is what you can expect from us:

**1. Major & minor version upgrades of core packages and Node.js versions**
  
We aim to release a new runtime that holds the major and minor upgrades of Playwright, Puppeteer and Node.js **every quarter**.
This will result in a new, named runtime e.g. `2023.03` available in the Checkly webapp and in our API.

**2. Patch releases and security patches**

We reserve the right to **update an existing runtime** with critical security patches if deemed necessary. We will only do
this if there are no known backwards compatibility issues.

## Why are runtimes important?

We introduced the concept of runtimes so customers can upgrade their JavaScript enhanced checks to more recent Node package versions
in a controlled fashion; and roll back if anything breaks! Before, this was a more risky "big bang" migration.
