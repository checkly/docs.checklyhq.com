Use URL monitors to track the availability of your HTTP-based services. They send a GET request to a specified URL and check for a successful response and acceptable response time.

Typical use cases include:

* Ensuring your marketing site returns a 200 OK
* Verifying your documentation site loads quickly
* Checking that your SSL certificate is still valid
* Confirming that a public pricing endpoint is reachable for customers

URL monitors are ideal for lightweight uptime monitoring. If a URL goes down, returns an unexpected status code, or responds too slowly, any configured [alerts](/docs/alerting-and-retries/) will be triggered.

## Creating a URL monitor

Each URL monitor is defined by its request configuration, which includes the target URL and how its availability and performance should be validated.

* **Request method:** Always `GET`.
* **URL:** The HTTP(S) URL to monitor (e.g. `https://api.example.com`).
* **IP family:** Defaults to IPv4.

To validate the response further, you can configure:

* **Response time limits:** Define latency thresholds for degraded or failed states.
* **Assertions:** Validate the returned response status code (e.g. expect `200`).

Additional settings for URL monitors include:

* **Name:** Give your monitor a clear name to identify it in dashboards and alerts.
* **Tags:** Use tags to organize monitors across dashboards and [maintenance windows](/docs/maintenance-windows/).
* **Scheduling strategy:** Choose between parallel or round-robin execution. Learn more about [scheduling strategies](/docs/monitoring/global-locations#scheduling-strategies).
* **Locations:** Select one or more [public](/docs/monitoring/global-locations/) or [private](/docs/private-locations/) locations to run the monitor from.
* **Scheduling:** Set how frequently the monitor runs (from every 10 seconds up to once every 24 hours).
* **Retries:** Define how failed runs should be retried. See [retry strategies](/docs/alerting-and-retries/retries/).
* **Alerting:** Configure your [alert settings](/docs/alerting-and-retries/alert-settings/), [alert channels](/docs/alerting-and-retries/alert-channels/), or set up [webhooks](/docs/alerting-and-retries/webhooks/) for custom integrations.

## CLI example

With the [Checkly CLI](/docs/cli/), you can define URL monitors in TypeScript or JavaScript and manage them as code.

{{< tabs "CLI example" >}}
{{< tab "TypeScript" >}}

```ts {title="hello-url.check.ts"}
import { UrlMonitor, UrlAssertionBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'

new UrlMonitor('hello-url-1', {
  name: 'Hello URL',
  activated: true,
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://api.checklyhq.com/v1/echo/get',
    assertions: [
      UrlAssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200),
    ]
  }
})
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "JavaScript" >}}

```js {title="hello-url.check.js"}
const { UrlMonitor, UrlAssertionBuilder } = require('checkly/constructs')

new UrlMonitor('hello-url-1', {
  name: 'Hello URL',
  activated: true,
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://api.checklyhq.com/v1/echo/get',
    assertions: [
      UrlAssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200),
    ]
  }
})
```
