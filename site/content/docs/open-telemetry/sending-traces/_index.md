Sending your checks as traces to a 3rd party OpenTelemetry backend is a great way to correlate check runs with other
telemetry data. It's also very simple to set up.
<!--more-->
1. Flip the **"Basic HTTP instrumentation"** toggle in the OpenTelemetry integration in your Checkly account.
2. Flip the **"Send traces"** toggle and provide the trace endpoint URL and API key for your preferred 3rd party OpenTelemetry
   backend. Done.

After you've set this up, Checkly will instrument every HTTP request with a proper `traceparent` and `tracestate` header
and send every check run as a trace to your 3rd party OpenTelemetry backend.
