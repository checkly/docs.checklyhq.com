This guide will help you instrument your Ruby on Rails application(s) with OpenTelemetry and send traces to Checkly.
<!--more-->
Although this guide is for [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), the steps are largely the same as instrumenting 
any Ruby application with OpenTelemetry. This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Ruby on Rails and already 
have a working Rails application.

## Step 1: Install the OpenTelemetry package

Go to the root of your Rails app and add the basic OpenTelemetry SDK, OTLP exporter and instrumentation gems to your Gemfile:

```bash
bundle add opentelemetry-sdk \
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp \
opentelemetry-instrumentation-all
```

This should add the following lines:
```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "opentelemetry-sdk", "~> 1.4"
gem "opentelemetry-exporter-otlp", "~> 0.26.3"
gem "opentelemetry-instrumentation-all", "~> 0.60.0"
```

## Step 2: Initialize the instrumentation

As per the Ruby on Rails convention, we add an `instrumentation.rb` file to the `config/initializers` directory.

```ruby
# config/initializers/instrumentation.rb

require 'opentelemetry/sdk'
require 'opentelemetry/instrumentation/all'

class ChecklySampler

    def should_sample?(trace_id:, parent_context:, links:, name:, kind:, attributes:)
      tracestate = OpenTelemetry::Trace.current_span(parent_context).context.tracestate
      decision = tracestate.value('checkly') ? OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Samplers::Decision::RECORD_AND_SAMPLE : 
        OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Samplers::Decision::DROP
      puts(decision)  
      OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Samplers::Result.new(decision: decision, attributes: {}, tracestate: tracestate)
    end
  
    def description
      'ChecklySampler'
    end
  end

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all()
end

OpenTelemetry.tracer_provider.sampler = ChecklySampler.new
```
Notice the `ChecklySampler` configuration. This is a custom, **head-based sampler** that will only sample spans that 
are generated by Checkly by inspecting the trace state. This way you only pay for the egress traffic generated by Checkly 
and not for any other traffic. Also note that the `use_all()` method will automatically install all available 
instrumentation libraries.

## Step 3: Start your app with the instrumentation

{{< markdownpartial "/_shared/otel-api-and-endpoint.md" >}}

You can now restart your Rails app with the instrumentation enabled.

```bash
rails server
```

## Debugging and troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, you can also output any traces to the console as follows:

```bash
env OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=console rails server
```

Similarly, you can set the `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `DEBUG` to get more detailed logs.

```bash
env OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG rails server
```
