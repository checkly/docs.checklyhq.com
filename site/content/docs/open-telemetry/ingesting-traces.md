Using the OpenTelemetry collector is the best way to manage and route telemetry data from / to Checkly. It requires
a little setting up, but it's worth it.
<!--more-->
In this guide we assume you already have an OTel collector running and configured. If you don't, please reference [the
Open Telemetry Collector getting started documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation/)


## Step 1: Update your config

Sending trace to Checkly is very simple with the OpenTelemetry collector. There are three sections you need to add
to your collector configuration file:

1. Create a `filter` that will remove all spans that don't have `checkly=true` in the trace state.
2. Create a new `exporter` with the Checkly API endpoint and API key as environment variables.
3. Hook the `exporter` and `filter` into a new trace pipeline.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:

processors:
  batch:
  filter/checkly:
    error_mode: ignore
    traces:
      span:
        # remove all spans that the trace state doesn't have an object
        # which key is "tracetest" and value is "true"
        - 'trace_state["checkly"] != "true"'

exporters:
  otlp/checkly:
    endpoint: "${env:CHECKLY_OTEL_API_ENDPOINT}"
    headers:
      authorization: "Bearer ${env:CHECKLY_OTEL_API_KEY}"
      "Content-Type": "application/json"

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [filter/checkly, batch]
      exporters: [otlp/checkly]
```

## Step 2: Restart your collector

Grab your **OTel API key** in the *Send traces* section of the [Open Telemetry Integration page in the Checkly app](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/open-telemetry).  
Now, export your API key in your shell by setting the `CHECKLY_OTEL_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
export CHECKLY_OTEL_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
```

Next, export the endpoint for the region you want to use:
```bash
export CHECKLY_OTEL_API_ENDPOINT="https://otel.eu-west-1.checklyhq.com"
# export CHECKLY_OTEL_API_ENDPOINT="https://otel.us-east-1.checklyhq.com"
```

Now, restart your collector with the updated configuration file. If you are using a Dockerized version of the OTel collector,
don't forget to pass in the environment variables, e.g.

```bash
docker run \
-e CHECKLY_OTEL_API_KEY \
-e CHECKLY_OTEL_API_ENDPOINT \
...
```

## Step 3: Verify your setup

You are done. Any traces ingested by your collector that are triggered by a Checkly synthetic check will now be sent to Checkly via the new pipeline.

If you are not using the OpenTelemetry collector, you can also [send traces directly to Checkly by instrumenting your application code](/docs/open-telemetry/instrumenting-code/).
