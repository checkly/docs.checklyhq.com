Setup and teardown scripts can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript/TypeScript code before and/or after an API check. 
Both script types have access to all environment variables, runtime objects like `request` and `response` and popular npm packages
like `moment`, `axios` and `lodash`.

To get the most power out of API checks with setup and teardown scripts, we advise using [the Checkly CLI](/docs/cli).
However, you can also use them [via our web UI](#using-setup-and-teardown-scripts-via-the-ui)

Setup and teardown scrips have a **maximum execution time of 10 seconds**.

## Setup scripts

Setup scripts allow you to process test data and configure API check requests. A setup script executes before any requests 
are made. You have access to a set of [built-in variables](#built-in-variables) to tweak the HTTP request (URL, headers etc.)
and a set of [3rd party libraries available in each runtime](/docs/runtimes/specs). Popular use cases are signing HMAC requests, 
requesting tokens and setting up test data.

Some simple examples are below:

```ts
// request.headers is a standard Javascript object

// Set a custom header
request.headers['X-Custom-Header'] = 'my value'

// Append a value to the request url
request.url = request.url + '/extra'

// Define a cookie
request.headers['Cookie'] = tokenString
```

### Authentication using setup scripts

A very common task for setup scripts is to fetch or sign some session token and use that token in the main API check.
You probably want to centralize that logic and use it across all you API checks. You can solve that problem elegantly
with the following structure.

1. Create an API check an reference the setup script (`setup.ts`) using the `entrypoint` property.
2. Encapsulate the actual authentication logic (fetching, signing etc.) in a separate `auth-client.ts` file. 
3. In the `setup.ts` file, import `common/auth-client.ts` and update the necessary fields in the `request` object.

Your folder structure would look as follows:

```
.
|-- api-1.check.ts
|-- setup.ts
`-- common
    `-- auth-client.ts

```

The API check performs a `GET` on an authenticated API endpoint, in this case `https://api.acme.com/v1.products`.

```ts
// api.check.ts
import { ApiCheck } from '@checkly/cli/constructs'
import * as path from 'path'

new ApiCheck('api-check-1', {
    name: 'Fetch Product Data',
    setupScript: {
        entrypoint: path.join(__dirname, 'setup.ts'),
    },
    request: {
        method: 'GET',
        url: 'https://api.acme.com/v1/products'
    }
})
```

The setup script uses the auth client and sets the `Authentication` header with a Bearer token. Notice two things:
- The `request` object is a global variable, injected at runtime. See the [request reference](#request) below for more details
- You need to use a top-level `await` statement as the `getToken()` function returns a `Promise`.

```ts
// setup.ts
import { getToken } from './common/auth-client'
const token = await getToken()
request.headers['Authentication'] = `Bearer ${token}`
```

The actual auth client doesn't do anything Checkly specific, besides reading a static environment variable `AUTH_SERVER_TOKEN`
that authenticates the request to the server issuing session tokens. You should store that static token in [your global
environment variables](/docs/api-checks/variables/#managing-variables).

```ts
// common/auth-client.ts
import axios from 'axios'

export async function getToken () {
    console.log('Fetching session token from auth server')
    const { data } = await axios.get('https://api.checklyhq.com/v1/runtimes', {
        headers: {
            authentication: process.env.AUTH_SERVER_TOKEN
        }
    })
    return data.token
}
```

The benefits from this structure are:

1. You can reuse the authentication logic across as many API checks as you want.
2. You can test the core authentication logic separately from any Checkly specific code.

The above example uses a fictional authentication server for simplicity. Check out our 
[setup script examples](/docs/api-checks/setup-script-examples/) for actual examples of OAuth2, HMAC signing, JWT tokens 
and other auth methods.

## Teardown scripts

Teardown scripts are run after the HTTP request has finished, but before any assertions are validated. Next to the 
[request](#request) object, teardown scripts also have access to the [response](#response) object. Use cases are cleaning 
up test data and scrubbing sensitive response data for regulatory reasons.

To learn more about teardown scripts, [check our teardown script examples](/docs/api-checks/teardown-script-examples/).

## Built-in variables

Inside each script, you have access to certain data structures of the API check lifecycle.

1. Environment variables for reading tokens and other secrets you have stored.
2. The `request` object.
3. The `response` object, only in teardown scripts as there is no response till after the API check runs.
4. General runtime variables injected automatically, like `process.env.CHECK_NAME`

### Environment

You have access to all environment variables configured in the variables section on the account page. You can create, read, 
update and delete any of the attributes in this object, but these mutations are only available during the lifetime of 
a single check run.

The current data center location the script is running in is exposed as the AWS region code in the `REGION` constant,
i.e. `eu-west-1` or `us-east-1`

```typescript
// read values and use them for further processing
const myValue = process.env.MY_KEY

// write values
process.env.MY_KEY = myValue + 10

// add a new key/value pair
process.env.NEW_KEY = 'new value'

// remove a key
delete process.env.SOME_OTHER_KEY
```

In setup scripts, the modified environment object is used for the subsequent HTTP request. In teardown
script, the modified environment object is just there for informational purposes.

[More about using environment variables](/docs/api-checks/variables/)

### Request

Request properties are exposed as a standard JavaScript object. This object is available in both setup and teardown scripts.

| property | description | type |
| ------------- | ------------- | --- |
| `request.method`  | The HTTP request method, i.e. 'GET', 'POST' etc. | String |
| `request.url`  | The request URL. Any separately defined query parameters are added at the end.  | String |
| `request.body`  | The request body in string format.  | String  |
| `request.headers`  | The request headers.  | Object |
| `request.queryParameters`  | The request query parameters. | Object |

### Response

Response properties are exposed a standard Javascript object. These are only available in teardown scripts.

| property | description | type |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---- |
| `response.statusCode`  | The response status code, i.e. 200 or 404.  | Number |
| `response.statusText`  | The response status text, i.e. 'Ok' or 'Not found'.  | String |
| `response.body`  | The response body in string format. You will need to use `JSON.parse(response.body)` to access JSON responses.| String |
| `response.headers`  | The response headers in the form of a standard Javascript object. | Object |
| `response.timings`  | Various timestamps for the request stage relative to the starting time.  | Object |
| `response.timingPhases`  | Time durations for each request phase. | Object |

### General runtime variables

[The setup and teardown runtime](/docs/runtimes/) also exposes a set of environment variables (e.g. `process.env.CHECK_NAME`)
to figure out what check, check type etc. you are running.

| property          | description                                                | type   |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `GROUP_BASE_URL`  | The `{{GROUP_BASE_URL}}` value of the grouped `API` check. | String |
| `CHECK_NAME`      | The name of the check being executed.                      | String |
| `CHECK_ID`        | The UUID of the check being executed.                      | String |
| `CHECK_TYPE`      | The type of the check being executed, (`API`)              | String |
| `CHECK_RESULT_ID` | The UUID of the result where the run result will be saved. | String |
| `REGION`          | The region where a check is executed, e.g `eu-west-1`      | String |
| `REQUEST_URL`     | The request URL of the `API` check executed.               | String |

## Included libraries

All setup and teardown scripts run in a sandboxed environment on our cloud backend. You do not have full access to the 
Node.js standard library or to arbitrary npm packages.

Check out [our runtimes documentation](/docs/runtimes/specs) for a full specification of which modules are included.

## Technical limitations

- Setup and teardown scripts are implicitly wrapped in async function. This means you can always use `await` statements.
- You cannot use nested callbacks as there is no way to determine the callback function. Always use `await` statements.
- You need to include modules and libraries explicitly, e.g. `const moment = require('moment')` before you can use them.
- You can pass a maximum of 256KB of data to and from the check's main request (e.g. using `request.body = data`).

## Using setup and teardown scripts via the UI

When using the Checkly web UI to create and run API checks, you can use setup and teardown script in the following two 
modes:

1. Using a inline piece of JS/TS code as shown below. This is great for quick, adhoc pieces of code you only use once.

![setup and teardown script for http requests](/docs/images/api-checks/setup-teardown-inline.png)

2. Using [snippets](/docs/snippets/) to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) up your code, and referencing those snippets by name.
This method approaches the way of working with the CLI, but is less flexible in general as you don't have direct access
to a full JS/TS environment.

![reusable code snippets](/docs/images/api-checks/snippets.png)

Once created, just select any snippets from the drop down menu in setup and teardown scripts section of your API check.

![setup and teardown script for http requests with snippets](/docs/images/api-checks/setup-teardown-snippet.png)

It's also possible to import snippets from your setup or teardown scripts. This can be valuable if setup and teardown 
scripts are similar across checks, but still require some customization.
Find more information in the [snippet documentation](/docs/snippets).

### Using environment variables via Handlebars

If your API Check's request body relies on data evaluated in a setup script, use [environment variables](/docs/api-checks/variables/) to make it accessible.

```typescript
// define a variable that should be accessible in the API Check response body
process.env.MY_VALUE = 'my value'
```

Access your defined environment variables in the API Check request body with `{{MY_VALUE}}` notation.

![Checkly API check editor showing a JSON request body that uses the MY_VALUE environment variable.](/docs/images/api-checks/setup-env-variables.png)
