{{< info >}}
Checkly traces are OpenTelemetry native. Currently in **beta** and available for free on all plans. 
Need help getting started? We offer a **free, 1:1 onboarding service** to help you instrument your stack with the 
correct OpenTelemetry SDKs and enable tracing inside Checkly. 
[Book an onboarding session right here](https://calendly.com/maria-checkly/traces-onboarding).

With Traces configured, you will have access to traces in all the places where it matters to more quickly resolve issues:
- **Check results:** resolve production outages faster by correlating failing checks with backend traces.
- **Test sessions:** understand any failures during test session execution.
- **Check editors:** get a live trace while building, editing and debugging check code.
