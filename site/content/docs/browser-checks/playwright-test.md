Checkly natively supports running browser checks using the Playwright Test Runner, allowing you to write tests and use 
assertions using the popular testing framework. Read more on how to utilise Playwright Test best in the 
[official documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests).

Playwright Test Runner elevates your monitoring and debugging experience by providing a number of neat functionalities:

- Detailed trace files with step-by-step information on your test cases.
- Video recordings of browser sessions
- The `expect()` function comes with built-in awaiting.
- Lots of web-first assertions like `toContainText()`, `toHaveURL()`
- High-level locators like `getByTitle`, `getByRole`
- Visual regression testing with the `toMatchSnapshot()` assertion.
- Independent nested test cases that make your Checkly check even more powerful.

Playwright Test is available from runtime [**2022.02**](/docs/runtimes/specs/) onwards.

## Features

This is the list of Playwright Test Runner features that are currently supported. We will update it as more features become supported.

## Browser check with multiple test cases
One of the key benefits of using Playwright Test is that you can split your check into multiple independent test cases,
and group them using the `test.describe` function. Your Checkly check will fail if **at least one** of the test cases fails.

{{< tabs "describe" >}}
{{< tab "TypeScript" >}}
 ```ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('two tests', () => {
  test('one', async ({ page }) => {
    // ...
  })

  test('two', async ({ page }) => {
    // ...
  })
})
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "JavaScript" >}}
 ```js
const { test } = require('@playwright/test')

test.describe('two tests', () => {
  test('one', async ({ page }) => {
    // ...
  })

  test('two', async ({ page }) => {
    // ...
  })
})
 ```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

{{< info >}}
An executed browser check that includes multiple Playwright test cases still counts as a single check run towards your pricing plan's defined limits.
{{</ info >}}

## Hooks
Playwright Test Runner offers hook functions such as `test.afterEach()` and `test.beforeEach()` that run before or after individual test cases or `test.afterAll()` and `test.beforeAll()` that run before or after all tests have started/finished.

You can find more information on available methods in the [official documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test).

## Viewing trace files
When a `@playwright/test` test case fails, Checkly will record and make its trace files available via the UI. You can download the trace files for manual inspection or view them directly with [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev).

Using the Playwright Trace Viewer you can effortlessly view your test, skip back and forth between actions, view snapshots and metadata, and more. This makes it very easy to inspect individual traces and debug failing tests.

<video alt="Viewing a Playwright Test trace file" autoplay loop muted src="/docs/images/browser-checks/pwt_traces.mp4"></video>

When running tests from the editor page, trace files are always available for download and preview,
regardless of whether the check is passing or failing. For scheduled check runs traces are only preserved when the check failed.

## Video recordings
When a `@playwright/test` test case fails, Checkly will record a video for each page navigation and make it available in the UI. It is a great tool to get a first look of the actions and their outcome to quickly identify what failed, and to visualize regressions.

Here's an example of a Playwright Test script that fails, and provides a video of the test sequence.

<video alt="Viewing a Playwright Test video" autoplay loop muted src="/docs/images/browser-checks/pwt_videos.mp4"></video>

When running tests from the editor page, video files are always available for download and preview, regardless of whether
the check is passing or failing. For scheduled check runs videos are only preserved when the check failed.

## PageObject Model (POM)

If you are structuring your test codebase following the [PageObject pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html), you can use the [Checkly CLI](/docs/cli) out of the box. Just make sure that:

- the folder you initialize your CLI in when building your project sits above your test spec files and their dependencies
- your `testMatch` is pointing to the path(s) where your test specs live

To see one way this can look like, see our [example repository](https://github.com/checkly/checkly-sample-pom).

## Global configuration

We are gradually rolling out support for global configuration options for the Playwright Test Runner. This allows you to 
configure your Playwright tests in a single place, instead of having to repeat the same configuration for each test file.

{{< info >}}
This feature is in **beta** and is only available when using the Checkly CLI to manage your checks and associated `.spec.ts|js` files.
{{< /info >}}

There are three things you should be aware of:
1. You can only use a subset of the Playwright config options. See the [supported configuration options](#supported-configuration-options) section for more information.
2. You need to add the `playwrightConfig` section to your `checkly.config.ts` file, nested under the `browserChecks` section.
3. We explicitly do not read from the existing `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js` file in your project. This is to avoid any confusion about which config file is used to run your tests and to prevent any unexpected behaviour.


If you have an existing `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js` file in your project that you want to import, 
you can simply run the [sync-playwright](/docs/cli/command-line-reference/#npx-checkly-sync-playwright)

```bash
npx checkly sync-playwright
```

This command will add currently supported Playwright config option to your `checkly.config.ts` file.

{{< tabs "project config" >}}
{{< tab "Typescript" >}}
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'

export default defineConfig({
  projectName: 'Website Monitoring',
  logicalId: 'website-monitoring-1',
  repoUrl: 'https://github.com/acme/website',
  checks: {
    checkMatch: '**/*.check.js',
    playwrightConfig: {         // note the extra playwrightConfig section
      timeout: 1234,
      use: {
        baseURL: 'https://www.checklyhq.com',
        isMobile: true,
      },

        }
      }
    },

    },
  },
  cli: {
    runLocation: 'eu-west-1',
    privateRunLocation: 'private-dc1'
  }
})
```

    checkMatch: '**/*.check.js',
    playwrightConfig: {           // note the extra playwrightConfig section
      timeout: 1234,
      use: {
        baseURL: 'https://www.checklyhq.com',

        }
      }
    },
    browserChecks: {

    },
  },
  cli: {
    runLocation: 'eu-west-1',
    privateRunLocation: 'private-dc1'
  }
})

module.exports = config;

{{< warning >}}
A check using [the Playwright Test Runner (`@playwright/test`)](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) will currently run around 30-50% longer than [a regular Playwright check (`playwright`)](https://playwright.dev/docs/library). This is caused by the automatic creation of trace and video assets. We are aware of this and are investigating solutions. If this is significantly degrading the performance of your check, we recommend to divide longer tests into multiple checks.
