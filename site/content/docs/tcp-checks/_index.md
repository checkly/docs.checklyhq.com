A TCP check establishes a connection to a specified hostname or IP address and port to verify that the service is responsive. These checks are ideal for monitoring non-HTTP services, such as databases, message queues, and custom applications that rely on TCP connectivity.

## Create a TCP check

{{< tabs "TCP check creation by interface" >}}
{{< tab "UI" >}}
<br>

* **Create a check:** Click the `+` icon on the sidebar and select **TCP check** from the list. This will open the check creation page.

* **Name & tags:** On the check creation page, choose a meaningful name for the check to easily identify it. Optionally, add one or more tags to further categorize or group the check.

* **The TCP request:** Configure the TCP endpoint to monitor by specifying a **hostname or IP address** (e.g., tcpbin.com or 192.168.1.1) and a **port** (e.g., 4242).

* **Set response time limits:** Define thresholds for marking the check as degraded or failed. This allows you to specify when requests should be considered slow (degraded) or entirely unreachable (failed).

* **Scheduling strategy & locations:** Choose a [scheduling strategy](/docs/monitoring/global-locations#scheduling-strategies) and which [location](/docs/monitoring/global-locations) you would like to run your TCP check from. Please note that [private locations](/docs/private-locations) are not yet supported for TCP checks but will be available soon.

* **Scheduling:** Schedule your checks to run at intervals between 10 seconds (minimum) and 24 hours (maximum).

* **Retries & alerting:** Configure [retries & alerts](/docs/alerting-and-retries) by choosing from Checkly's retry strategies and alert channels, ensuring youâ€™re notified through your preferred methods when an issue arises with one of your TCP checks.

## TCP check reporting

Learn more about analyzing your TCP check run results in our [check results documentation](/docs/monitoring/check-results#tcp-check-results).

## TCP check pricing

A TCP check is billed the same way as API checks. For more details, refer to our [pricing and billing documentation](/docs/monitoring/check-pricing).
