Triggering a group of checks in your CI/CD pipeline works exactly the same as triggering a single check. 

There are two big differences:

1. We run all the checks in your group. Checkly looks at your **concurrency** setting to determine how many checks we
fire at once.

2. The result reported now is an aggregate of all check runs, with individual check results as part of the message, i.e.


## GitHub deployment triggers

We can run your check group whenever GitHub sends out a deployment webhook. Works great with services like 
[Vercel](https://vercel.com) and [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

To get started:
 1. [install the Checkly GitHub app as described here](/docs/cicd/github/)
 2. Link a repo from the **CI/CD** tab in your group
 3. Trigger your first deployment
 
Checkly will run your group and provide a detailed report right in GitHub:

## Command line triggers

On any CI/CD platform, you can just call our API with a dedicated URL and get the results of a group run.
Command line trigger for group work exactly the same as described in our [CI/CD command line trigger documentation](/docs/cicd/trigger/) 

The only difference is the result we send back. Instead of a single object, we return an array of results that details the
name, UUID, response time and failure status of each check in the group.
