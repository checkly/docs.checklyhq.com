...but things fail all the time. It's how you respond that makes the difference. Get quick and contextful alerts on any channel
you want. Know when your service fails before your customers do.

The internet can be flaky. Sometimes a failing service is just fine 2 seconds later. **Dodge false positives** by specifying
exactly when you should be alerted and how often you want to be reminded.

Choose one or more of the available alerting channels. We have everything from **email, to Pagerduty, Opsgenie and SMS**. Need something
custom? Use the webhooks or hook up [our Prometheus integration](/docs/integrations/prometheus/) and roll your own alerting.
