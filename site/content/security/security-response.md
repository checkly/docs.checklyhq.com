# 🔑 Checkly security response

## Help us stay secure
We want to make Checkly as secure as possible. We take measures to not store any PII if possible. However, we are human
and will make mistakes so your input and feedback on our security is always appreciated.

## Reporting security problems
Send urgent reports directly to info@checklyhq.com. We’ll get back to you ASAP, usually within 24 hours.
Please follow up or ping us on Twitter [@checklyHQ](https://twitter.com/checklyHQ) if you don’t hear back. For requests that aren’t urgent or sensitive: submit a
support request.

## Disclosing security issues
We work with security researchers and pen testers to keep up with the state-of-the-art in web security. If you discovered a
security flaw that might impact our customer and / or our products, please let us know. This is what we'll do:

- We’ll acknowledge your report and keep you updated on its status.
- We’ll investigate the issue and determine its impact. We won’t disclose issues until our investigation is finished.
- Once the issue is resolved, we’ll post a security update along with thanks and credit for the discovery.

## Thanks for helping small companies stay secure
