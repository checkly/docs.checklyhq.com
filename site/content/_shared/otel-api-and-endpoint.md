First, make sure to switch on the **Basic HTTP Instrumentation**. This will add the necessary headers to your HTTP requests.

![Checkly basic OTEL http instrumentation](/docs/images/otel/otel_basic_instrumentation.png)

Then, toggle on **Send Traces**, grab your OTel API key in the **OTel API keys** section of the [Open Telemetry Integration page in the Checkly app](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/traces) and
take a note of the endpoint for the region you want to use.

Now, export your API key in your shell by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable.

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="authorization=<your-api-key>"
```

Next, export the endpoint for the region you want to use and give your service a name.
```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://otel.eu-west-1.checklyhq.com"
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="your-service-name"
```

During the beta we only have one region available: `eu-west-1`. We will expand to US regions soon.
