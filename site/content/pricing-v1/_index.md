#### What are API checks?

API checks are monitors that issue POST, GET and other typical HTTP requests at API endpoints. You have full control
over the payload, headers etc. In addition, you can create assertions to check if the response from your
API is valid and performant.

#### What are browser checks?

Browser checks are monitors based on Node.js scripts using industry-standard testing tools like Mocha, Puppeteer, and Playwright.
Each browser check uses an actual Chrome browser to execute clicks, fill out forms and validate if these interactions have
the correct results. This is also commonly called "synthetic monitoring".

#### Do all plans have the same scheduling options?

API checks can be run **every minute**, whereas browser checks start at **10 minute** intervals. Longer intervals (30 minutes, once per day etc.)
are the same for all check types.

#### Can I get a custom plan with more / less checks?

Yes, we can customize the plan exactly to your needs. 500 API checks and 0 browser checks, or any combination really.
Just <a href="#" class='open-intercom-link'>contact us</a> and we'll make you a quote.

#### Are all alerting integrations the same for all plans?

All plans have SMS, email, webhook and Slack integrations to alert you when a check fails. From the Starter plan onwards
we add integrations like Pagerduty and give you more SMS credits.

#### How does the 14-day trial work?
By signing up, you get full access to all of Checkly's functions for a period of 14 days. You do not need a credit card
to get started. After the 14 day period, you will still have access to your account but we will suspend the running of
your checks.

#### Can I switch plans easily?

Absolutely. You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any moment from your account page. We will prorate the cost so you always pay exactly what
you owe: no double bookings. We will also add a proration line to your invoice.

#### What payment types do you accept?

We accept Visa, Mastercard and American Express credit card payments. All payments are handled by Stripe.

#### Do you support early startups or nonprofits?
Yes! We do support early-stage startups that are younger than two years. 
And nonprofits do qualify for a free Developer plan. <a href="https://forms.gle/V5fMnaD1ABCfPNfdA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apply here</a>
