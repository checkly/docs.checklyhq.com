      title: OpenAPI/Swagger Monitoring
      text: OpenAPI and Swagger help users design and document APIs in a way that is readable from both humans and machines. As a consequence, they can also be used to generate the code that will run the specified API - both on the provider and consumer side. Can we leverage this same principle to simplify API monitoring? After a brief first look at OpenAPI and Swagger, this article will show how we can quickly use them to monitor a new or existing API.

      title: Monitoring-as-Code
      text: The trend of declaring infrastructure as code has been picking up steam over the last few years, offering a way for DevOps teams to transparently manage and scale cloud infrastructure. Why should the way we manage monitoring be any different? In this article, we address this point and illustrate it with a practical example of Monitoring-as-Code on Checkly.

      title: Migrating from Puppeteer to Playwright
