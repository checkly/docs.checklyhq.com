{{< sm-4-col-item "Deeper Insights" "Pingdom is great when you want to know if your websites are up. But it doesn't show you whether your web app and endpoints are working correctly and performing well." >}}
{{< sm-4-col-item "Flexible HTTP Checks" "Checkly provides powerful insights and tools to customize your checks. Instead of a simple ping, you can create fully fledged configurable HTTP checks to monitor APIs." >}}
{{< sm-4-col-item "Powerful E2E Checks" "Monitor your vital click flows in a real Chrome browser. With Checkly you can use Javascript to code your checks, instead of using a restrictive scripting editor." >}}
