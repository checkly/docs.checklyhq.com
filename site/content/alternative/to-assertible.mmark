## Why Checkly and not Assertible?

<p class="text-center hero-sub hero-sub-center mb-lg-5">
Checkly is built for developers and engineering teams eager to monitor their cloud native applications.

{{< sm-4-col-item "Combined E2E & API checks" "Assertible is great when you want to know if your APIs are up. But it doesn't show you the full picture - whether your UI flows and endpoints are working correctly." >}}
{{< sm-4-col-item "Powerful Synthetics" "Monitor your websites with a real Chrome browser. With Checkly you can use JavaScript to code your checks, instead of using a restrictive scripting editor." >}}
{{< sm-4-col-item "Developer-first platform" "Use our delightful UI or simply code. Checkly provides powerful API, SDK, and a Terraform provider to enable you to configure your checks via code." >}}

Code your checks and control exactly how they interact with a real browser.
