API monitoring is the practice of evaluating how an API (Application Programming Interface) is performing over time via several different metrics, including verifying availability, verifying correctness (i.e., is the data that is being sent and received correctly?), and measuring performance and asserting that against a performance threshold. The goal is to determine whether the APIs are functioning as they should and whether they are available and functioning at an optimal level for the other applications and services that rely on them.

Tracking performance data of APIs, such as response times and variations in performance in the context of different environments, enables you to identify issues with them before customers and other stakeholders do, helping you avoid extended periods of downtime or degraded performance.

## Why is API Monitoring Important?

When a web application or website delivers less than optimal performance—or fails—the impact on your business or customer experience can be significant. API monitoring tools can be used to check your mobile, web app, or other APIs for *performance*, *correctness*, and *availability*.

- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitoring an API endpoint for response time to requests could involve measuring TCP, DNS, and first byte times.
- **Correctness Monitoring:** Checking that an API is returning the correct data payload, authentication, status codes, and headers and validating that any given API is functioning correctly.
- **Availability Monitoring:** Whether your API is available from a single location or via multiple points across the globe, availability is a vital monitoring metric. If an API is accessible on a global basis, monitoring that API from various locations across the globe can give you insight into any region-specific issues.

A good monitoring solution can provide information on all of the aspects outlined above. Once equipped with this knowledge, teams can take the appropriate steps to both fix any damage done as well as [improve suboptimal APIs](https://blog.dreamfactory.com/8-tips-for-optimizing-an-api/) for long-term stability.

More importantly, having an efficient alerting regimen working in concert with your monitoring solution can ensure that the right people are notified of problems as soon as they emerge. Precise and accurate reporting then provides additional insights necessary for a successful investigation into the problem. All of this translates into faster time to recovery, fewer problems being encountered by the end-user, and helps mitigate revenue loss.

## Benefits of API Monitoring

API monitoring offers several important benefits that enhance the efficiency, security, and performance of applications and systems. It enables organizations to proactively monitor and detect potential issues, ensuring smooth operations. Here are the key advantages of API monitoring:

| **Benefits** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Improved Insights and Performance | Continuous API monitoring provides valuable insights to enhance operations. It identifies bottlenecks, optimizing response times and resource utilization. It also tracks API dependencies, ensuring seamless performance. Moreover, monitoring ensures high availability and detects anomalies for prompt issue resolution. |
| Enhanced API Performance | Thanks to API monitoring, you can track performance over time, which then enables you to reduce latency, optimize scalability, detect errors, and optimize caching. |
| Improved API Metrics | Monitoring elevates API metrics, including uptime and [SLAs](https://www.checklyhq.com/blog/sla-slo-sli/). It tracks API uptime, ensuring uninterrupted service, and measures performance against SLAs. By monitoring key metrics like response times and error rates, deviations from agreed standards are promptly addressed. |
| API Responses Accuracy | Ensuring the accuracy of API responses is crucial. Monitoring validates data against predefined rules, detects errors, and sets up alert notifications for quick actions. It also provides performance insights related to accuracy. |

Incorporating API monitoring into your software development workflow is instrumental in optimizing operations, enhancing user experiences, and making data-driven decisions for continuous improvements.

## API Monitoring Use Cases

Each team will have its own primary use case for API monitoring, but the most common use cases will usually be one of the following.

- **Endpoint Uptime Monitoring**: The simple monitoring of 'are we returning 200 responses and valid objects?' Regular pinging of API endpoints to ensure they are operational, which is critical for service availability.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Tracking the response times of APIs to assess and maintain optimal performance levels. A more analog measurement than uptime monitoring. Seeing that your response times are slipping can indicate underlying infrastructure issues or technical debt in code performance.
- **Global Availability Checks**: Testing API availability and responsiveness from various global locations to ensure consistent user experiences worldwide. Especially when you have differences in data sovereignty or other cloud architecture differences, this becomes a key check. When I was in Enterprise Services, I always checked our global status first when a high-level customers complained of outages, as geo differences were the most common cause of a hidden issue.
- **Versioning and Deployment Validation**: Using [synthetic monitoring](https://www.checklyhq.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-monitoring/) post-deployment to confirm that the API functions as expected, catching issues beyond the scope of unit or integration tests. It's even possible to hook these results directly to a canary deployment system!
- **SLA Compliance Monitoring**: Measuring API performance and uptime against Service Level Agreements to maintain customer trust and transparency. This SRE's best tool for tracking SLA compliance is an effective API monitoring tool.

## Do You Need to Monitor APIs Constantly?

With applications relying heavily on APIs for their functioning, monitoring APIs on a regular, consistent basis becomes a necessary practice in any software development and maintenance project. Companies that are committed to ensuring that end-users have a positive and smooth experience with their product often take advantage of the best API monitoring tools and services to notify them of any issues before customers encounter them.

Around-the-clock, 24/7 API monitoring is essential to catch any issues with APIs that could negatively impact the health of applications. Without API monitoring in place, businesses risk the development of gaps in their knowledge of the application’s status, which can have severe consequences for the stability of the application, and the end-users’ experience of it.

Another compelling reason for 24/7 monitoring is that there are multiple points of potential failure in API operations. An update to the API itself might introduce a bug, which leads to downtime or performance degradation, but the same might happen due to infrastructure reasons (e.g., maybe a server or a hosted cloud instance is overloaded). API monitoring should ideally be incorporated into a team’s larger API testing and monitoring efforts so that they can have a comprehensive view and understanding of the application performance and its various components at any given point in time.

## How to Monitor Your APIs

Now that we have established what API monitoring is and why businesses should adopt it as part of their development process, here are some tips to get started.

The first step is to identify which APIs are currently being employed by your system, including both internal APIs as well as external third party APIs. Understanding the exact role they play in the development of your application is crucial to knowing which metrics need to be monitored and tested. Important metrics such as [API response time](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/api-checks/limits/), availability, and data correctness are a few that you will be interested in keeping an eye on.

Requests are sent to the API, whose responses are evaluated in terms of speed, availability, and correctness. In case the response received does not meet the standards laid out for it, the [API check](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/api-checks/) registers an error. It is common for monitors to send a second request to that API in the event of a failure. If the API is unreachable or its response is once again inadequate, an alert is triggered, and pre-defined developers and API-providers are informed about the situation.

The next step is to choose an API monitoring tool that will best support your needs. A good monitoring tool will [run checks](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/monitoring/) across all your APIs frequently and be able to check for various metrics across criteria such as performance and correctness. With [Checkly](https://app.checklyhq.com/signup?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=organic&amp;utm_term=get-started-section) you can establish a high frequency of checks, which allows you to observe the status of the target system with greater granularity. For example, a critical API endpoint could be monitored every ten seconds to ensure that any issues are caught immediately rather than waiting on a slower monitoring frequency. Additionally, Checkly enables you to monitor APIs from over 20 locations to ensure that they operate smoothly globally.

![A diagram of dependencies](/learn/images/api-monitoring-02.png)

By default, you have access to a free Team trial which expires after 14 days, so in order to continue enjoying the advanced features, you can [subscribe to a pricing plan](https://www.checklyhq.com/pricing/) depending on your needs and requirements.

### Step 2: Create a New Check

Once you've signed up and logged in, you can proceed to a [Browser Check](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/browser-checks/), API Check or use the CLI script.

Let’s play around with the API Check. On your dashboard, click the "API Check" tab (you can toggle between tabs). You should see an interface like this:

![A diagram of dependencies](/learn/images/api-monitoring-03.png)

You can either check your API, by entering the URL and selecting the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) the URL accepts, import using a cURL command or import from Swagger or OpenAPI.

For instance, using cURL, make a request to your API in your browser, go to the developer tools and find the particular request you want to monitor. Let’s use a request from [https://fakestoreapi.com](https://fakestoreapi.com/), and copy the request from the Chrome developer tools as cURL just like the image below:

![the Checkly interface](/learn/images/api-monitoring-04.png)

Here is what the cURL looks like:

```bash
curl 'https://fakestoreapi.com/products/1' \
  -H 'authority: fakestoreapi.com' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'accept-language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \
  -H 'dnt: 1' \
  -H 'if-none-match: W/"16c-MMdrqY6N0sTiefLdsgtBej9eunY"' \
  -H 'referer: https://fakestoreapi.com/' \
  -H 'sec-fetch-dest: empty' \
  -H 'sec-fetch-mode: cors' \
  -H 'sec-fetch-site: same-origin' \
  -H 'user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 13_2_3 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/13.0.3 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1' \
  --compressed
```

Go back to your Checkly dashboard and click the “Import a cURL command” button. A dialog box will pop up. Paste the cURL you copied in the input field and then click “Import cURL”.

Now, you should have a more detailed interface containing information and settings for the API request.

### Step 3: Configure the Request Settings

In this step, you need to configure various settings for your check. Start by giving your check a name that describes its purpose or functionality. You can also add optional tags to categorize your checks.

Next, since the cURL command already specified the request details such as the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), URL, headers, body/query parameters and authorization (tokens or API keys), the Checkly UI enables you to change/update these details.

### Step 4: Set Up Monitoring Frequency

Monitoring frequency determines how often Checkly will send requests to your API endpoint to check its availability and performance across multiple or selected data centers under the “SCHEDULING & LOCATIONS” tab.

![the Checkly interface](/learn/images/api-monitoring-06.png)


You can choose from various intervals like every minute or custom intervals based on your needs. You can also add assertions and limits to validate specific response criteria like status codes or response time.

### Step 5: Define Alert Channels

Alert channels allow you to receive notifications when issues or errors are detected during API monitoring. Checkly supports multiple alert channels including email, phone calls, SMS, Slack, Discord, Telegram, PagerDuty, Webhooks and more. Configure the desired alert channels and provide relevant contact information.

### Step 6: Review and Save

Before saving your check configuration, it's essential to review all the settings and ensure they accurately meet your needs and requirements. Double-check the request details, assertions, monitoring frequency, and alert channels. Once you're satisfied, click the green “Save Check” button at the right-top corner.

### Step 7: Monitor and Analyze

With your API check set up, Checkly will start monitoring your APIs according to the defined frequency. You can now sit back and let Checkly do its job.

Checkly provides comprehensive dashboards and reports to help you analyze the performance and health of your APIs. Utilize these insights to identify potential bottlenecks, optimize response times, and ensure overall reliability.

From our example in this article, Checkly is monitoring the API from our Fake Store API.

## Frequently asked questions

Learn more about API monitoring and how it helps you to avoid production issues.

### How often should you check the health of your APIs?
There's no silver bullet when choosing the best monitoring interval. The main question is: How long can you afford broken API endpoints to go unnoticed? If you monitor your API endpoints only once an hour, and your API goes down, your discovery time can take up to one hour, too, depending on the time of the outage.

We recommend choosing [short monitoring intervals for critical endpoints](https://www.checklyhq.com/blog/check-frequency/) going down to ten seconds to receive alerts almost in real time. For non-critical endpoints, a longer interval might suit you as well.

### Q: How can businesses ensure the correctness of API responses?
When API responses change, this change often only appears when relying applications break. This results in a broken user experience. API monitoring prevents this from happening. A well-defined API monitoring solution enables developers to monitor API uptime but also API correctness and accuracy.

[API check assertions](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/api-checks/assertions/) allow you to define what API responses you expect from your API endpoints. Check assertions range from testing essential HTTP response headers to well-formed and correct JSON responses. 

You know your API best and should be as specific as possible to avoid user-facing production issues.

### Q: How does 'Monitoring as Code' change traditional API monitoring approaches?

Unlike traditional API monitoring services that rely on manual configuration, the [Monitoring as Code](https://www.checklyhq.com/product/monitoring-as-code/) approach enables developers to define and configure their API and end-to-end monitors in code. With Monitoring as Code, the entire monitoring configuration lives in source control next to the application code. The monitoring infrastructure can be tested in preview environments and will be updated when deploying to production via CI/CD.

Having your monitoring setup defined in code eases the monitoring maintenance. Monitoring changes can be quickly retraced via version control; rollbacks can be applied via CI/CD and manual monitoring ClickOps will be banished.

### Q: What metrics are most critical when monitoring an API?

The obvious [API monitoring metrics](https://www.checklyhq.com/learn/monitoring/metrics-every-team-needs/) are API uptime and correctness. An unavailable or broken endpoint directly affects user experience. But they're not the only metrics to monitor.

API performance metrics are essential for a well-running API, too. Do your API endpoints respond to global HTTP requests in an acceptable time? And if they don't, are you aware of your API's degraded performance?

To ensure a well-running API, you must constantly look at performance metrics because slow API responses will lead to a poor user experience of the products relying on these APIs. API response time is essential, but to find the cause of a slowed-down API, specific metrics such as DNS resolution time or time to first byte are handy tools to understand what's causing a performance regression.

### Q: How does API monitoring differ from website monitoring?

Website monitoring describes practices to check a website's availability, correctness, and user experience. These checks can be performed in various ways, from [real user monitoring](/learn/monitoring/real-user-monitoring/) to [synthetic monitoring](/learn/monitoring/synthetic-monitoring/) mimicking real-user behavior with headless browsers.

API monitoring takes an active approach to monitoring APIs. An API monitor performs scheduled HTTP requests and alerts you when API endpoints become unavailable or degrade in performance.

### Q: How do you handle false alarms in API monitoring?

False alarms are a common problem in any active API monitoring solution because they'll trigger false alerts. API call retries are a standard solution to avoiding alerts caused by flaky APIs. 

A suitable retry solution is a balance between timely and valid alerts. How often do you want to retry until you get alerted? And how quickly do you want to retry an API call? And in what interval should your API be pinged again?

The answers to these questions vary depending on the API and the urgency of downtime. A more extended retry period might be sufficient for some APIs, whereas, for others, a quick and single retry is the best approach. No matter your preference, your monitoring solution must provide [configurable retry strategies](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/alerting-and-retries/#how-often-should-i-retry).
