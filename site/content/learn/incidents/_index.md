We’ve all been there, the 3AM phone call, the bleary-eye scanning of a Slack channel, the debates over what to say on the status page, the rollbacks, the restarts, and the attempts to find root causes and deploy a fix. Incident management happens every day, and when it’s working well both your users and your leadership may be barely aware of it. But when incidents are severe or when incident management isn’t done well, it’s the only thing anyone wants from your product.

In the last decade as the whole world has grown to accept software-as-a-service, the standards for uptime and responsiveness to issues have increased steadily. While day-long maintenance windows and hours-long outages were par for the course in 2015, now even an outage of a few minutes can affect business health.
Further, expectations about uptime have gone from ‘best practices’ to ‘binding agreements with financial costs for failures,’ with enterprise clients demanding service level agreements (SLAs) with penalty schedules if uptime goals aren’t met.
