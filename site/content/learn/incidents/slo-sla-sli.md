SLAs provide a contractual foundation, SLOs establish performance objectives, and SLIs offer tangible metrics to measure success. This triad ensures a holistic approach to service management, aligning customer expectations with organizational capabilities.

## Practical Example: Implementing SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs for APIs

In the context of managing a customer-facing, business-critical API, it's essential to establish clear standards and expectations to ensure high-quality service. Here, we dive into an example that outlines SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs, using a practical scenario.

### SLI: Service Level Indicator

The SLI acts as a measure of the performance and reliability of the API. In this case, the SLI is defined by the API's ability to respond successfully with HTTP status codes ranging from 200 to 499, coupled with a response time of under one second. This metric is crucial because it quantifies the operational performance of the API from a technical standpoint, focusing on availability and speed.

### SLO: Service Level Objective

Building on the SLI, the SLO sets a target for the level of service the API aims to deliver. For our API, the objective is that the SLI conditions (response codes within 200-499 and response times below one second) are met for the 99th percentile of all requests. This means that out of 100 requests, at least 99 should satisfy these criteria. The SLO is a commitment to maintaining a high standard of service, ensuring that nearly all requests are handled efficiently and effectively.

### SLA: Service Level Agreement

The SLA transforms the SLO into a formal agreement with the customer. It guarantees that the service will achieve the SLO targets for a specified period, in this case, a quarter. The SLA also outlines the compensation customers will receive if the service fails to meet these expectations. This compensation could take various forms, such as financial credits, discounts, or other remedies. The SLA is a crucial part of customer contracts, providing a legal framework that ensures accountability and offers reassurance to customers about the reliability of the service.

By setting these SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs, the company not only commits to delivering a high-quality API service but also provides transparency and trust to its customers. This framework helps manage expectations, foster customer satisfaction, and drive continuous improvement in service performance.
