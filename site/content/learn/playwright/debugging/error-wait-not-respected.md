Our script might sometimes look as if it were not honoring the waits we are specifying, instead proceeding and potentially running into an error on the next instruction. 

For example: we are waiting for an element, e.g. with `page.waitForSelector`, but the script immediately proceeds to the next instruction. This can result in an [element not found error](#element-not-found) or similar on the following step in our script.

## Possible causes

- **Not-so-obvious possible cause:** the element we are waiting for is already in the DOM, possibly not visible in our inspection but already matching our `state` requirements. 

## How to avoid confusion

Try querying for the element in the browser console during inspection. If the element is found, inspect its attributes (e.g. `visibility`) and ensure they match your expectations.
