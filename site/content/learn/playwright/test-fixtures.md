Playwright's test fixtures are a powerful feature for sharing setup and teardown logic across tests, promoting code reuse and maintainability. This guide walks you through creating a custom test fixture, demonstrating its utility in a practical scenario.

## Understanding Playwright Test Fixtures

At their core, fixtures in Playwright are predefined components like `page`, `context`, `browser`, and `browserName` that you can use across different test cases. They encapsulate functionality into modular blocks, simplifying test setup and teardown.

## Fixtures: Puppeteer vs Playwright

Both [Playwright](https://www.checklyhq.com/learn/headless/basics-playwright-intro/) and [Puppeteer](https://www.checklyhq.com/learn/headless/basics-puppeteer-intro/) are open source projects to help you simulate user behavior with a browser on your site. Their approach to fixtures—reusable pieces of code for setting up and tearing down tests—differs significantly. While fixtures are a basic component in Playwright, Puppeteer doesn’t offer native fixture support, relying on manually coded helper functions.

### Puppeteer and Fixtures

Puppeteer, developed by the Chrome DevTools team, focuses on simplicity and direct control over the Chrome or Chromium browser. It doesn't natively support fixtures in the same way Playwright does. Instead, setup and teardown routines must be manually coded within each test or abstracted into reusable functions by the developer. This approach offers flexibility but can lead to more boilerplate code and a higher chance of inconsistency across tests.

### Custom Test Fixture Implementation

To use fixtures in Puppeteer, developers typically create helper functions or classes that encapsulate setup and teardown logic. This method requires more upfront work and a good understanding of asynchronous JavaScript patterns.

```js
async function withPage(test) {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  try {
    await test(page);
  } finally {
    await page.close();
    await browser.close();
  }
}

// Usage
withPage(async (page) => {
  // Test actions using the page
});
```

This pattern mimics fixture behavior but lacks the built-in, framework-level support found in Playwright, potentially leading to more complex and less maintainable test suites.

## Playwright and Fixtures

Playwright and its test runner Playwright Test, on the other hand, were designed with a broader testing scope and includes first-class support for fixtures. This design choice streamlines the setup and teardown process, making tests cleaner and reducing redundancy.

### Built-in Support

Playwright's test runner provides a rich set of predefined fixtures, such as `browser`, `context`, `page`, and `request`, and allows for easy customization and extension of these fixtures. This built-in support enables more structured and maintainable tests, with less manual setup required.

```js
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

// Configure the native `page` fixture with pre-defined state
test.use({ storageState: 'authenticated-state.json' });

test('My authenticated test', async ({ page }) => {
  // Test actions using the authenticated page
});
```

The ability to extend and customize fixtures in Playwright not only reduces boilerplate but also enhances test isolation and reusability across your test suite.

## Choosing between Puppeteer and Playwright

While both Puppeteer and Playwright offer powerful capabilities for browser automation, their approach to fixtures represents a significant difference in philosophy. Puppeteer offers flexibility and direct control, requiring developers to implement their own fixture-like functionality. Playwright, in contrast, integrates fixtures deeply into its testing framework, promoting code reuse, maintainability, and ease of use.

Choosing between Puppeteer and Playwright will depend on your project's specific needs, the complexity of your tests, and your team's familiarity with JavaScript testing patterns. If fixtures and test structure are a priority, Playwright Test might be the more suitable choice. However, for projects that require fine-grained browser control and are less concerned with test setup and teardown complexity, Puppeteer remains a strong option.

## Create a Custom Test Fixture in Playwright Test

Imagine testing a web application where multiple tests require logging in. Repeating login logic in every test is inefficient and violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

Let's implement __a fixture to reuse and share code across Playwright test cases__.

### Step 1: Extend the Test Object

First, create a new test file or use an existing one. Here, we're testing a web application with Playwright, accessing environment variables, and performing UI interactions.

To create a custom fixture, extend the `test` object provided by Playwright:

```js
// fixture.js
import { test as baseTest } from '@playwright/test';

const test = baseTest.extend({
  webApp: async ({ page }, use) => {
    // Your setup logic here
    // Logging into the web application, etc...
    // ...
    console.log('setup');

    // After logging in, pass the `page`
    // object to the test cases
    //
    // Whatever you call `use` with
    // will be available in your test cases
    await use(page);

    // Teardown logic, if any
    console.log('teardown');
  },
});
```

By using custom fixtures, test cases can reuse code defined in the `test.extend` call. In this case, all tests using the extended `test` method can rely on the `webApp` fixture.

### Step 2: Use the Custom Fixture

With the `webApp` fixture defined, you can use it in your tests. The fixture code will only run when a test "requests" to use it. For example, the custom `webApp` fixture will only be executed if a test case uses it.

Replace `page` with `webApp` and use the fixture in your test cases:

```js
test('My webApp test', async ({ webApp }) => {
  // Your test code here, using the already logged in webApp fixture
});
```

The `webApp` fixture encapsulates the login logic, making it accessible to any test that requires it.

### Step 3: Debugging and Validation

Debugging is crucial to ensure your fixture works as expected. Playwright's inspector is invaluable here, allowing you to step through test execution and verify the setup and teardown processes.

### Step 4: Sharing Across Tests

To share your custom fixture across different test files, encapsulate it in a separate module:

```js
// setup.js
import { test as baseTest, expect } from '@playwright/test';

export const test = baseTest.extend({ /* Your fixture definition */ });
export { expect };
```

Then, in your test files, import this extended `test` and use the custom fixtures:

```js
// tests/your-test.spec.js
import { test, expect } from './setup';
```

This approach keeps your tests clean and focused, with shared logic abstracted into fixtures.

## Replace `beforeEach` / `afterEach` Hooks with Automatic Fixtures

As explained in the previous section, fixtures enable the sharing and distributing of code across Playwright tests. By default, fixture code is only executed when a test case accesses a fixture. But there are scenarios in which you always want to run your fixture code, like global `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks.

Let's implement __an automatic fixture to log the current time before and after every test case__.

### Define an Automatic Fixture

If you want to run code before and after each test case, you can reach for the commonly known `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks.

In the following example, we log the current time before and after every test to the console.

```js
test.beforeEach(async ({}) => {
  console.log(`Start time: ${new Date()}`);
});

test('my test', async ({ page }) => {
  expect(page.url()).toBe('https://my.start.url/');
});

test.afterEach(async ({}) => {
  console.log(`End time: ${new Date()}`);
});
```

This approach works fine, but if you want to run the same code for **every test**, you must place these `beforeEach` and `afterEach` calls in every `spec` file. Additionally, `beforeEach` and `afterEach` don't share the same function scope. This behavior leads to unexpected errors in some scenarios.

A more convenient way to implement global test hooks is relying on automatic fixtures. Like the `webApp` fixture defined in the previous section, you must extend the `test` object to use automatic fixtures.

```js
import { test as baseTest } from '@playwright/test';

export const test = baseTest.extend({
  // Define an automatic fixture
  // Note: `timelogger` is defined as any array to provide an options object
  timeLogger: [
    async ({}, use) => {
      // Do something before every test
      // ...
      console.log(`Start time: ${new Date()}`);

      // Start the test case
      //
      // Note: `use` is called without any arguments because
      // automatic fixtures run regardless if they're requested or not
      await use();

      // Do something after every test
      // ...
      console.log(`End time: ${new Date()}`);
    },
    // Specify that this fixture should be an automatic fixture
    { auto: true },
  ],
});

export { expect } from "@playwright/test";
```

The main difference between default and automatic fixtures is that automatic fixtures run regardless. In our example, the `timeLogger` fixture will be executed for every running test.

## Conclusion

Custom test fixtures in Playwright streamline test setup and teardown, fostering code reuse and reducing boilerplate. Encapsulating common functionality, such as user logins or global setups, into fixtures ensures your tests are cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to read.
