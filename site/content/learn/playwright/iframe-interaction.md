Playwright enables us to access and interact with iframes.

## Locate an iframe and its elements

To access iframe elements, locate the iframe and query the DOM elements as if you're in the page context.

{{< tabs "1" >}}
{{< tab "Playwright" >}}
```js
{{< readfile filename="samples/playwright/iframe-access.js" >}}
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}
