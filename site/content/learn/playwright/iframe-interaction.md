Playwright enables us to access and interact with iframes.

## Locate an iframe and its elements

To access iframe elements, locate the iframe and query the DOM elements as if you're in the page context.

```ts {title="iframe-access.spec.ts"}
{{% readfile filename="samples/playwright/iframe-access.spec.ts" %}}
```
