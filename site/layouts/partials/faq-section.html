It enables developers to easily run standard Chrome
browsers in "headless" mode. Although it doesn't output anything to a screen it keeps all of its features for rendering a web page. To get you started with the Puppeteer framework, we created
the  GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/checkly/puppeteer-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checkly/puppeteer-examples</a> with example scripts.</p><h5>How is it different from PhantomJS or Selenium?</h5><p>PhantomJS and its partner library CasperJS are based on the QT Webkit browser. Also, they are not "native" Node.js applications.
Selenium and the Webdriver standard are Java applications that "talk to" browsers. Setup is complex and you always need Java.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6"><h5>How much is this going to cost?</h5><p>Pricing details haven't been worked out completely. The aim is to provide a plan for
even the most cash strapped developers and startups.</p><h5>Is there a roadmap?</h5><p>During and after the beta launch we will gather as much user feedback as possible and base the roadmap on that.</p></div></div></div></section>
